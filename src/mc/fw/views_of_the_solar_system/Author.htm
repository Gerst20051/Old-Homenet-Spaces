Calvin J. Hamilton</h1>
<p>Calvin J. Hamilton received his bachelors and masters degrees in electrical engineering 
from Brigham Young University. He graduated in 1988, and since that time has pursued 
his interest of image processing. He has been involved in developing algorithms 
and software used for pattern recognition, wavelet compression, medical imaging, 
gravity wave imaging, and image enhancement. Hamilton&#39;s image processing expertise 
combined with his interest in astronomy led to the creation of <b><i>Views of the 
Solar System</i></b>. </p>
<p>In 1993, Hamilton became intrigued with astronomy and images of the solar system. 
At that time he found that the Internet lacked quality images and information on 
astronomical bodies. In his research, he found many beautiful pictures in printed 
publications, that were not on the Internet. He determined to make some of these 
and other high quality photographs of the planets and satellites available to the 
public. </p>
<p>Hamilton obtained raw NASA spacecraft image data which requires a certain amount 
of image processing before it is presentable. He began processing the spacecraft 
images and placed the results on the Internet. He did considerable original processing 
of imagery from Venus, Mars, the outer planets, and the Solar System&#39;s numerous 
satellites. As his images grew in number, he added statistical, geological, and 
descriptive information to go along with each body in the solar system. Little by 
little <b><i>Views of the Solar System</i></b> began to be built. </p>
<p>Calvin J. Hamilton is currently residing in Maryland with his wife, and two children.

Because of the volume of e-mail I get, I can only respond to a fraction of the e-mail. 
However, I will always respond to requests to use images or information. Before 
you send me e-mail you might want to take a look at the copyright page to see if 
it answers your questions. For example, you do not need my permission to use a NASA 
image. </p>
