<p><b>What is Stroke?</b><br id="XSpLit109">

A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly 
interrupted or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the 
spaces surrounding brain cells. Brain cells die when they no longer receive 
oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around 
the brain. The symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, 
especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or 
understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble 
with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe 
headache with no known cause. There are two forms of stroke: <i>ischemic</i> - 
blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and <i>hemorrhagic</i> - 
bleeding into or around the brain. </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Generally there are three 
  treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, 
  and post-stroke rehabilitation. Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent 
  stroke are based on treating an individual's underlying risk factors for 
  stroke, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes. Acute stroke 
  therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the 
  blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a 
  hemorrhagic stroke. Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome 
  disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the 
  most common treatment for stroke. The most popular classes of drugs used to 
  prevent or treat stroke are antithrombotics (antiplatelet agents and 
  anticoagulants) and thrombolytics

<p><b>What is the prognosis?</b><br>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Although stroke is a disease 
  of the brain, it can affect the entire body. A common disability that results 
  from stroke is complete paralysis on one side of the body, called <i>
  hemiplegia</i>. A related disability that is not as debilitating as paralysis 
  is one-sided weakness or <i>hemiparesis</i>. Stroke may cause problems with 
  thinking, awareness, attention, learning, judgment, and memory. Stroke 
  survivors often have problems understanding or forming speech. A stroke can 
  lead to emotional problems. Stroke patients may have difficulty controlling 
  their emotions or may express inappropriate emotions. Many stroke patients 
  experience depression. Stroke survivors may also have numbness or strange 
  sensations. The pain is often worse in the hands and feet and is made worse by 
  movement and temperature changes, especially cold temperatures. </p>
  <p>Recurrent stroke is frequent; about 25 percent of people who recover from 
  their first stroke will have another stroke within 5 years.

<p><b>What research is being done?</b><br>
&nbsp;<span psxedit="disorder_research"><disorder_research /></p>
<div class="rxbodyfield" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office">
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The National Institute of 
  Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts stroke research and 
  clinical trials at its laboratories and clinics at the National Institutes of 
  Health (NIH), and through grants to major medical institutions across the 
  country. Currently, NINDS researchers are studying the mechanisms of stroke 
  risk factors and the process of brain damage that results from stroke. Basic 
  research has also focused on the genetics of stroke and stroke risk factors. 
  Scientists are working to develop new and better ways to help the brain repair 
  itself to restore important functions.&nbsp; New advances in imaging and 
  rehabilitation have shown that the brain can compensate for function lost as a 
  result of stroke.</div>
