<!-- INBODYEND -->The term meteor comes from the Greek <i>meteoron</i>, meaning 
phenomenon in the sky. It is used to describe the streak of light produced as matter 
in the solar system falls into Earth&#39;s atmosphere creating temporary incandescence 
resulting from atmospheric friction. This typically occurs at heights of 80 to 110 
kilometers (50 to 68 miles) above Earth&#39;s surface. The term is also used loosely 
with the word meteroid referring to the particle itself without relation to the 
phenomena it produces when entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. A meteoroid is matter 
revolving around the sun or any object in interplanetary space that is too small 
to be called an asteroid or a comet. Even smaller particles are called micrometeoroids 
or cosmic dust grains, which includes any interstellar material that should happen 
to enter our solar system. A meteorite is a meteoroid that reaches the surface of 
the Earth without being completely vaporized.
<p>One of the primary goals of studying meteorites is to determine the history and 
origin of their parent bodies. Several achondrites sampled from Antarctica since 
1981 have conclusively been shown to have originated from the moon based on compositional 
matches of lunar rocks obtained by the Apollo missions of 1969-1972. Sources of 
other specific metorites remain unproven, although another set of eight achondrites 
are suspected to have come from Mars. These meteorites contain atmospheric gases 
trapped in shock melted minerals which match the composition of the Martian atmosphere 
as measured by the <a HREF="viking.htm">Viking</a> landers in 1976. All other groups 
are presumed to have originated on asteroids or comets; the majority of meteorites 
are believed to be fragments of asteroids. </p>

<p>Meteorites have proven difficult to classify, but the three broadest groupings 
are stony, stony iron, and iron. The most common meteorites are chondrites, which 
are stony meteorites. Radiometric dating of chondrites has placed them at the age 
of 4.55 billion years, which is the approximate age of the solar system. They are 
considered pristine samples of early solar system matter, although in many cases 
their properties have been modified by thermal metamorphism or icy alteration. Some 
meteoriticists have suggested that the different properties found in various chondrites 
suggest the location in which they were formed. Enstatite chondrites contain the 
most refractory elements and are believed to have formed in the inner solar system. 
Ordinary chondrites, being the most common type containing both volatile and oxidized 
elements, are thought to have formed in the inner asteroid belt. Carbonaceous chondrites, 
which have the highest proportions of volatile elements and are the most oxidized, 
are thought to have originated in even greater solar distances. Each of these classes 
can be further subdivided into smaller groups with distinct properties. </p>
<p>Other meteorite types which have been geologically processed are achondrites, 
irons and pallasites. Achondrites are also stony meteorites, but they are considered 
differentiated or reprocessed matter. They are formed by melting and recrystallization 
on or within meteorite parent bodies; as a result, achondrites have distinct textures 
and mineralogies indicative of igneous processes. Pallasites are stony iron meteorites 
composed of olivine enclosed in metal. Iron meteorites are classified into thirteen 
major groups and consist primarily of iron-nickel alloys with minor amounts of carbon, 
sulfur, and phosphorus. These meteorites formed when molten metal segregated from 
less dense silicate material and cooled, showing another type of melting behavior 
within meteorite parent bodies. Thus, meteoritescontain evidence of changes that 
occurred on the parent bodies from which they were removed or broken off, presumably 
by impacts, to be placed in the first of many revolutions. </p>
<p>The motion of meteoroids can be severely perturbed by the gravitational fields 
of major planets. Jupiter&#39;s gravitational influence is capable of reshaping an asteroid&#39;s 
orbit from the main belt so that it dives into the inner solar system and crosses 
the orbit of Earth. This is apparently the case of the Apollo and Vesta asteroid 
fragments. </p>
<p>Particles found in highly correlated orbits are called a stream components and 
those found in random orbits are called sporadic components. It is thought that 
most meteor streams are formed by the decay of a comet nucleus and consequently 
are spread around the original orbit of the comet. When Earth&#39;s orbit intersects 
a meteor stream, the meteor rate is increased and a meteor shower results. A meteor 
shower typically will be active for several days. A particularly intense meteor 
shower is called a meteor storm. Sporadic meteors are believed to have had a gradual 
loss of orbital coherence with a meteor shower due to collisions and radiative effects, 
further enhanced by gravitational influences. There is still some debate concerning 
sporadic meteors and their relationship with showers. </p>

<b>Martian Meteorite</b> <br>
This meteorite, a basalt lava rock nearly indistinguishable from many Earth rocks, 
provided the first strong proof that meteorites could come from Mars. Originally 
weighing nearly 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), it was collected in 1979 in the Elephant 
Moraine area of Antarctica. The side of the cube at the lower left in this image 
measures 1 centimeter (0.4 inches). </p>
<p>This picture shows a sawn face of this fine-grained gray rock. (The vertical 
stripes are saw marks.) The black patches in the rock are melted rock, or glass, 
formed when a large meteorite hit Mars near the rock. The meteorite impact probably 
threw this rock, dubbed &quot;EETA79001,&quot; off Mars and toward Antarctica on Earth. The 
black glass contains traces of martian atmosphere gases. This meteorite is 180 million 
years old. </p>
<p>The <a href="explorationrover.htm">Mars Exploration</a> Rover Opportunity has 
discovered that a rock dubbed &quot;Bounce&quot; at Meridiani Planum has a very similar mineral 
composition to this meteorite and likely shares common origins. Bounce itself is 
thought to have originated outside the area surrounding Opportunity&#39;s landing site; 
an impact or collision likely threw the rock away from its primary home.<i>(Courtesy

<b>Chondrite Meteorite</b> <br>
This meteorite was collected from the Allan Hills in Antarctica. Meteorites are

Discovered at Reckling Peak, Antarctica, this type of meteorite is known as an achondrite. 
It has a <a HREF="terms.htm#basalt">basaltic</a> composition and was probably formed 
when an asteroid melted about 4.5 billion years ago. The asteroid broke up some

<b>A Martian Meteorite</b> <br>
This meteorite, called EETA 79001, was found on the ice in Antarctica, and is quite 
likely from Mars. For scale, the cube at the lower right is 1 centimeter on a side. 
The meteorite is partly covered by a black glassy layer, the fusion crust. The fusion 
crust forms when the meteorite enters the Earth&#39;s atmosphere at high speed. Friction 
heating melts the outer portion of the meteorite. Inside, the meteorite is gray. 
It is a <a HREF="terms.htm#basalt">basalt</a>, very similar to basalts found on 
Earth. It formed in a volcanic eruption about 180 million years ago. This meteorite 
is quite likely from Mars because it contains a small amount of gas that is chemically 
identical to the Martian atmosphere. <i>(Courtesy LPI)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Microscopic View of a Martian Meteorite</b> <br>
Rocks are often made of small mineral grains that can&#39;t be seen clearly without 
a microscope. To see these small grains, scientists grind and polish rock samples 
very thin (0.03 millimeters) so light can pass through them. This microscopic view, 
2.3 millimeters (.09 inches) across, is in false color, produced by holding polarizing 
filters above and below the microscopic slide. These filters cause different minerals 
to have distinctive colors, allowing easy identification of the minerals. Most of 
this meteorite (in yellow, green, pink, and black) is the mineral olivine, which 
is common in some basaltic rocks. The striped grain near the center is the mineral 
pyroxene. <i>(Courtesy Allan Treiman, LPI)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Vesta Meteorite</b> <br>
This meteorite is assumed to be a sample of the crust of the asteroid
<a HREF="vesta.htm">Vesta</a>, which is only the third solar system object beyond 
Earth where scientists have a laboratory sample (the other extraterrestrial samples 
are from Mars and the Moon). The meteorite is unique because it is made almost entirely 
of the mineral pyroxene, common in lava flows. The meteorite&#39;s mineral grain structure 
also indicates it was once molten, and its oxygen isotopes are unlike oxygen isotopes 
found for all other rocks of the Earth and Moon. The meteorite&#39;s chemical identity 
points to the asteroid Vesta because it has the same unique spectral signature of 
the mineral pyroxene. </p>
<p>Most of the identified meteorites from Vesta are in the care of the Western Australian 
Museum. This 1.4 pound (631 gm) specimen comes from the New England Meteoritical 
Services. It is a complete specimen measuring 9.6 x 8.1 x 8.7 centimeters (3.7 x 
3.1 x 3.4 inches), showing the fusion crust, evidence of the last stage in its journey 
to Earth. <i>(Photo Credit: R. Kempton, New England Meteoritical Services)</i>
