<p>It is the one and only Wonder which does not require a description by early historians 
and poets. It is the one and only Wonder that does not need speculations concerning 
its appearance, size, and shape. It is the oldest, yet it is the only surviving 
of the Seven Ancient Wonders. It is the Great Pyramid of Giza. </p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>At the city of Giza, a necropolis of ancient Memphis, and today part of Greater
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/cairo/index.html">Cairo</a>,
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/index.html">Egypt</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Contrary to the common belief, only the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), not 
all <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Cairo/Gallery/pyr.jpg">three Great Pyramids</a>, 
is on top of the list of Wonders. The monument was built by the Egyptian pharaoh 
Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty around the year 2560 BC to serve as a tomb when he dies. 
The tradition of pyramid building started in Ancient Egypt as a sophistication of 
the idea of a <i>mastaba</i> or &quot;platform&quot; covering the royal tomb. Later, several 
stacked <i>mastabas</i> were used. Early pyramids, such as the
<a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/arth/zoser/zoser.html">Step Pyramid of King Zoser 
(Djoser)</a> at <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/arth/zoser/08.gif">Saqqara</a> 
by the famous Egyptian architect, Imhotep, illustrate this connection. </p>
<p>The great pyramid is believed to have been
<a href="http://communityhigh.org/usr/graham/westernciv/theories.html">built</a> 
over a 20 year period. The site was first prepared, and blocks of stone were transported 
and placed. An outer casing (which disappeared over the years) was then used to 
smooth the surface. Although it is not known how the blocks were put in place,
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/pyramid-construction.html">several 
theories</a> have been proposed. One theory involves the construction of a straight 
or spiral ramp that was raised as the construction proceeded. This ramp, coated 
with mud and water, eased the displacement of the blocks which were pushed (or pulled) 
into place. A second theory suggests that the blocks were placed using long levers 
with a short angled foot. </p>
<p>Throughout their history, the pyramids of Giza have stimulated human imagination. 
They were referred to as &quot;The Granaries of Joseph&quot; and &quot;The Mountains of Pharaoh&quot;. 
When
<a href="http://www.biography.com/cgi-bin/biography/biography-request.pl?page=/biography/data/N/N.10144.txt.html">
Napoleon</a> invaded Egypt in 1798, his pride was expressed through his famous quote: 
&quot;Soldats! Du haut de ces Pyramides, 40 siècles nous contemplent&quot;. <i>(Soldiers! 
From the top of these Pyramids, 40 centuries are looking at us)</i> </p>
<p>Today, the Great Pyramid is enclosed, together with the other pyramids and the
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Cairo/Gallery/sphinx.jpg">Sphinx</a>, in the 
touristic region of the
<a href="http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/COMP/GIZ/MODEL/Giza_Model.html">Giza 
Plateau</a>. Also in the area is the museum housing the mysterious
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Cairo/Gallery/sunboat.jpg">Sun Boat</a>, only 
discovered in 1954 near the south side of the pyramid. The boat is believed to have 
been used to carry the body of Khufu in his last journey on earth before being buried 
inside the pyramid. It may also serve him as a means of transportation in his afterlife 
journey according to
<a href="http://chs-web.neb.net/usr/graham/westernciv/mythology.html">Ancient Egyptian 
beliefs</a>. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When it was built, the Great pyramid was 145.75 m (481 ft) high. Over the years, 
it lost 10 m (30 ft) off its top. It ranked as the tallest structure on Earth for 
more than 43 centuries, only to be surpassed in height in the nineteenth century 
AD. It was covered with a casing of stones to smooth its surface (some of the casing 
can still be seen near the top of
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/pyramid.jpg">Khefre&#39;s pyramid</a>). 
The sloping angle of its sides is 51 degrees and 51 minutes. Each side is carefully 
oriented with one of the cardinal points of the compass, that is, north, south, 
east, and west. The horizontal cross section of the pyramid is square at any level, 
with each side measuring 229 m (751 ft) in length. The maximum error between side 
lengths is astonishingly less than 0.1%. </p>
<p>The structure consists of approximately 2 million blocks of stone, each weighing 
more than two tons. It has been suggested that there are enough blocks in the three 
pyramids to build a 3 m (10 ft) high, 0.3 m (1 ft) thick wall around
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/france/">France</a>. The area covered by 
the Great pyramid can accommodate
<a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/citta/B-Pietro.jpg">St Peter&#39;s</a> in Rome, 
the cathedrals of
<a href="http://www.infogroup.it/FirenzeByNet/min/duo/uzeb.jpg">Florence</a> and
<a href="http://www.tulane.edu/lester/text/Gothic/Late.Gothic/Late.Gothic37.html">
Milan</a>, and <a href="http://russell.webtravel.org/atwj/engwestm.jpg">Westminster</a> 
and <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/misc/uk/london/stpauls.jpg">St Paul&#39;s</a> in 
London combined. </p>
<p>On the north face, is the pyramid&#39;s entrance. A number of corridors, galleries, 
and escape shafts either lead to the King&#39;s burial chamber, or were intended to 
serve other functions. The King&#39;s chamber is located at the heart of the pyramid, 
only accessible through the Great Gallery and an ascending corridor. The King&#39;s 
sarcophagus is made of red granite, as are the interior walls of the King&#39;s Chamber. 
Most impressive is the sharp-edged stone over the doorway which is over 3 m (10 
ft) long, 2.4 m (8 feet) high and 1.3 m (4 ft) thick. All of the interior stones 
fit so well, a card won&#39;t fit between them. The sarcophagus is oriented in accordance 
with the compass directions, and is only about 1 cm smaller in dimensions than the 
chamber entrance. It might have been introduced as the structure was progressing.
</p>
<p>New theories concerning the origin and purpose of the Pyramids of Giza have been 
proposed... Astronomic observatories... Places of cult worship... Geometric structures 
constructed by a long-gone civilization... Even extraterrestrial-related theories 
have been proposed with little evidence in support... The overwhelming scientific 
and historic evidence still supports
<a href="http://www2.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/nova/pyramid/">the conclusion</a> that, 
like many smaller pyramids in the region, the Great Pyramids were built by the great 
Ancient Egyptian civilization off the West bank of the Nile as tombs for their magnificent 
Kings... Tombs where Khufu, Khefre, and Menkaure could start their mystic journey 
to the afterlife. </p>
