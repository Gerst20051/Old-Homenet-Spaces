<p><b>What is Migraine?</b><br id="XSpLit109">
The pain of a migraine headache is often described as an intense pulsing or 
throbbing pain in one area of the head. It is often accompanied by extreme 
sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting. Migraine is three times 
more common in women than in men. Some individuals can predict the onset of a 
migraine because it is preceded by an &quot;aura,&quot; visual disturbances that appear as 
flashing lights, zig-zag lines or a temporary loss of vision. People with 
migraine tend to have recurring attacks triggered by a lack of food or sleep, 
exposure to light, or hormonal irregularities (only in women). Anxiety, stress, 
or relaxation after stress can also be triggers. For many years, scientists 
believed that migraines were linked to the dilation and constriction of blood 
vessels in the head. Investigators now believe that migraine is caused by 
inherited abnormalities in genes that control the activities of certain cell 
populations in the brain. </p>

  There are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs: 
  prevent the attacks, or relieve the symptoms during the attacks. Many people 
  with migraine use both approaches by taking medications originally developed 
  for epilepsy and depression to prevent future attacks, and treating attacks 
  when they happen with drugs called triptans that relieve pain and restore 
  function. Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be 
  linked to their menstrual cycle. Stress management strategies, such as 
  exercise, relaxation, biofeedback, and other therapies designed to help limit 
  discomfort, may also reduce the occurrence and severity of migraine attacks.

  Taking a combination of drugs to prevent and treat migraine attacks when they 
  happen helps most people with migraine to limit the disabling effects of these 
  headaches. Women whose migraine attacks occur in association with their 
  menstrual cycle are likely to have fewer attacks and milder symptoms after 
  menopause.

  Researchers believe that migraine is the result of fundamental neurological 
  abnormalities caused by genetic mutations at work in the brain. Investigations 
  of the more rare, familial subtypes of migraine are yielding information about 
  specific genes and what they do, or don't do, to cause the pain of migraine 
  headache. Understanding the cascade of biological events that happen in the 
  brain to cause a migraine, and the mechanisms that underlie these events, will 
  give researchers opportunities to develop and test drugs that could prevent or 
  interrupt a migraine attack.</div>
