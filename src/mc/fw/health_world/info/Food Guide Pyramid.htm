      <td width="100%">The Food Guide Pyramid is one way for people to understand 
      how to eat healthy. A rainbow of colored, vertical stripes represents the 
      five food groups plus fats and oils. Here&#39;s what the colors stand for:<ul>
        <li>orange - grains </li>
        <li>green - vegetables </li>
        <li>red - fruits </li>
        <li>yellow - fats and oils </li>
        <li>blue - milk and dairy products </li>
        <li>purple - meat, beans, fish, and nuts </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) changed the pyramid in spring 
      2005 because they wanted to do a better job of telling Americans how to be 
      healthy. The agency later released a special version for kids. Notice the 
      girl climbing the staircase up the side of the pyramid? That&#39;s a way of showing 
      kids how important it is to
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/stay_healthy/fit/work_it_out.html">exercise</a> 
      and be active every day. In other words, play a lot! The steps are also a 
      way of saying that you can make changes little by little to be healthier. 
      One step at a time, get it?</p>
      <p><strong>The Pyramid Speaks<br>
      </strong>Let&#39;s look at some of the other messages this new symbol is trying 
      to send:</p>
      <p><strong>Eat a</strong> <strong>variety</strong> <strong>of foods.</strong> 
      A balanced diet is one that includes all the food groups. In other words, 
      have foods from every color, every day.</p>
      <p><strong>Eat less of some foods, and more of others.</strong> You can see 
      that the bands for meat and protein (purple) and oils (yellow) are skinnier 
      than the others. That&#39;s because you need less of those kinds of foods than 
      you do of fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy foods.</p>
      <p>You also can see the bands start out wider and get thinner as they approach 
      the top. That&#39;s designed to show you that not all foods are created equal, 
      even within a healthy food group like fruit. For instance, apple pie might 
      be in that thin part of the fruit band because it has a lot of added sugar 
      and fat. A whole apple - crunch! - would be down in the wide part because 
      you can eat more of those within a healthy diet.</p>
      <p><strong>Make it personal.</strong> Through the USDA&#39;s MyPyramid website, 
      people can get personalized recommendations about the mix of foods they need 
      to eat and how much they should be eating. There is a kids&#39; version of the 
      website available too.</p>
      <p><strong>How Much Do I Need to Eat?<br>
      </strong>Everyone wants to know how much they should eat to stay healthy. 
      It&#39;s a tricky question, though. It depends on your age, whether you&#39;re a girl 
      or a boy, and how active you are. Kids who are more active burn more
      <a id="link1" href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/nutrition/food/calorie.html">
      calories</a>, so they need more calories. But we can give you some estimates 
      for how much you need of each food group.</p>
      <p><strong>Grains<br>
      </strong>Grains are measured out in ounce equivalents. What the heck are they? 
      Ounce equivalents are just another way of showing a serving size.</p>
      <p>Here are ounce equivalents for common grain foods. An ounce equivalent 
      equals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 piece of bread </li>
        <li>1/2 cup of cooked cereal, like oatmeal </li>
        <li>1/2 cup of rice or pasta </li>
        <li>1 cup of cold cereal </li>
      </ul>
      <p>* 4- to 8-year-olds need 4-5 ounce equivalents each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old girls need 5 ounce equivalents each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old boys need 6 ounce equivalents each day.</p>
      <p>And one last thing about grains: Try to eat a lot of whole grains, such 
      as 100% wheat bread, brown rice, and oatmeal.</p>
      <p><strong>Vegetables<br>
      </strong>Of course, you need your vegetables, especially those dark green 
      and orange ones. But how much is enough? Vegetable servings are measured in 
      cups.</p>
      <p>* 4- to 8-year-olds need 1 1/2 cups of veggies each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old girls need 2 cups of veggies each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old boys need 2 1/2 cups of veggies each day.</p>
      <p><strong>Fruits<br>
      </strong>Sweet, juicy fruit is definitely part of a healthy diet. Here&#39;s how 
      much you need:</p>
      <p>* 4- to 8-year-olds need 1-1 1/2 cups of fruit each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old girls need 1 1/2 cups of fruit each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old boys need 1 1/2 cups of fruit each day.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Milk and Other Calcium-Rich Foods<br>
      </strong>Calcium builds strong bones to last a lifetime, so you need these 
      foods in your diet.</p>
      <p>* 4- to 8-year-olds need 1-2 cups of milk (or another calcium-rich food) 
      each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old girls need 3 cups of milk (or another calcium-rich food) 
      each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old boys need 3 cups of milk (or another calcium-rich food) 
      each day.</p>
      <p>If you want something other than milk, you can substitute yogurt, cheese, 
      or calcium-fortified orange juice - just to name a few.</p>
      <p><strong>Meats, Beans, Fish, and Nuts<br>
      </strong>These foods contain
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/nutrition/food/minerals.html">iron</a> 
      and lots of other important nutrients. Like grains, these foods are&nbsp; 
      measured in ounce equivalents.</p>
      <p>An ounce equivalent of this group would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ounce of meat, poultry, or fish </li>
        <li>1/4 cup cooked dry beans </li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of peanut butter </li>
        <li>a small handful of nuts or seeds </li>
      </ul>
      <p>* 4- to 8-year-olds need 3-4 ounce equivalents each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old girls need 5 ounce equivalents each day.<br>
      * 9- to 13-year-old boys need 5 ounce equivalents each day.</p>
      <p>Whoa! That&#39;s a lot to swallow. The good news is that your mom, dad, and 
      the other grown-ups in your life will help you eat what you need to stay healthy. 
      There&#39;s more good news - you don&#39;t have to become a perfect eater overnight. 
      Just remember those stairs climbing up the side of the new pyramid and take 
      it one step at a time.</p>
