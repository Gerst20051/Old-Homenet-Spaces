<p>Although Pluto was discovered in 1930, limited information on the distant planet 
delayed a realistic understanding of its characteristics. Today Pluto remains the 
only planet that has not been visited by a spacecraft, yet an increasing amount 
of information is unfolding about this peculiar planet. The uniqueness of Pluto&#39;s 
orbit, rotational relationship with its satellite, spin axis, and light variations 
all give the planet a certain appeal. </p>
<p>Pluto is usually farther from the <a HREF="sun.htm">Sun</a> than any of the nine 
planets; however, due to the eccentricity of its orbit, it is closer than
<a HREF="neptune.htm">Neptune</a> for 20 years out of its 249 year orbit. Pluto 
crossed Neptune&#39;s orbit January 21, 1979, made its closest approach September 5, 
1989, and remained within the orbit of Neptune until February 11, 1999. This will 
not occur again until September 2226. </p>
<p>As Pluto approaches <a HREF="terms.htm#perihelion">perihelion</a> it reaches 
its maximum distance from the <a HREF="terms.htm#ecliptic">ecliptic</a> due to its 
17-degree inclination. Thus, it is far above or below the plane of Neptune&#39;s orbit. 
Under these conditions, Pluto and Neptune will not collide and do not approach closer 
than 18 A.U. to one another. </p>
<p>Pluto&#39;s rotation period is 6.387 days, the same as its satellite Charon. Although 
it is common for a satellite to travel in a <a HREF="terms.htm#syncrot">synchronous 
orbit</a> with its planet, Pluto is the only planet to rotate synchronously with 
the orbit of its satellite. Thus being tidally locked, Pluto and Charon continuously 
face each other as they travel through space. </p>
<p>Unlike most planets, but similar to <a HREF="uranus.htm">Uranus</a>, Pluto rotates 
with its poles almost in its orbital plane. Pluto&#39;s rotational axis is tipped 122 
degrees. When Pluto was first discovered, its relatively bright south polar region 
was the view seen from the Earth. Pluto appeared to grow dim as our viewpoint gradually 
shifted from nearly pole-on in 1954 to nearly equator-on in 1973. Pluto&#39;s equator 
is now the view seen from <a HREF="earth.htm">Earth</a>. </p>
<p>During the period from 1985 through 1990, Earth was aligned with the orbit of 
Charon around Pluto such that an <a HREF="terms.htm#eclipse">eclipse</a> could be 
observed every Pluto day. This provided opportunity to collect significant data 
which led to <a HREF="terms.htm#albedo">albedo</a> maps defining surface reflectivity, 
and to the first accurate determination of the sizes of Pluto and Charon, including 
all the numbers that could be calculated therefrom. </p>
<p>The first eclipses (mutual events) began blocking the north polar region. Later 
eclipses blocked the equatorial region, and final eclipses blocked Pluto&#39;s south 
polar region. By carefully measuring the brightness over time, it was possible to 
determine surface features. It was found that Pluto has a highly reflective south 
polar cap, a dimmer north polar cap, and both bright and dark features in the equatorial 
region. Pluto&#39;s geometric albedo is 0.49 to 0.66, which is much brighter than Charon. 
Charon&#39;s albedo ranges from 0.36 to 0.39. </p>
<p>The eclipses lasted as much as four hours and by carefully timing their beginning 
and ending, measurements for their diameters were taken. The diameters can also 
be measured directly to within about 1 percent by more recent images provided by 
the Hubble Space Telescope. These images resolve the objects to clearly show two 
separate disks. The improved optics allow us to measure Pluto&#39;s diameter as 2,274 
kilometers (1413 miles) and Charon&#39;s diameter as 1,172 kilometers (728 miles), just 
over half the size of Pluto. Their average separation is 19,640 km (12,200 miles). 
That&#39;s roughly eight Pluto diameters. </p>
<p>Average separation and orbital period are used to calculate Pluto and Charon&#39;s 
masses. Pluto&#39;s mass is about 6.4 x 10<sup>-9</sup> solar masses. This is close 
to 7 (was 12 x&#39;s) times the mass of Charon and approximately 0.0021 Earth mass, 
or a fifth of our moon. </p>
<p>Pluto&#39;s average <a HREF="terms.htm#density">density</a> lies between 1.8 and 
2.1 grams per cubic centimeter. It is concluded that Pluto is 50% to 75% rock mixed 
with ices. Charon&#39;s density is 1.2 to 1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, indicating it contains 
little rock. The differences in density tell us that Pluto and Charon formed independently, 
although Charon&#39;s numbers derived from HST data are still being challenged by ground 
based observations. Pluto and Charon&#39;s origin remains in the realm of theory.
</p>
<p>Pluto&#39;s icy surface is 98% nitrogen (N2). Methane (CH4) and traces of carbon 
monoxide (CO) are also present. The solid methane indicates that Pluto is colder 
than 70 Kelvin. Pluto&#39;s temperature varies widely during the course of its orbit 
since Pluto can be as close to the sun as 30 AU and as far away as 50 AU. There 
is a thin atmosphere that freezes and falls to the surface as the planet moves away 
from the Sun. NASA plans to launch a spacecraft, the Pluto Express, in 2001 that 
will allow scientists to study the planet before its atmosphere freezes. The atmospheric 
pressure deduced for Pluto&#39;s surface is 1/100,000 that of Earth&#39;s surface pressure.
</p>
<p>Pluto was officially labeled the ninth planet by the International Astronomical 
Union in 1930 and named for the Roman god of the underworld. It was the first and 
only planet to be discovered by an American, Clyde W. Tombaugh. </p>
<p>The path toward its discovery is credited to Percival Lowell who founded the 
Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona and funded three separate searches for 
&quot;Planet X.&quot; Lowell made numerous unsuccessful calculations to find it, believing 
it could be detected from the effect it would have on Neptune&#39;s orbit. Dr. Vesto 
Slipher, the observatory director, hired Clyde Tombaugh for the third search and 
Clyde took sets of photographs of the plane of the solar system (ecliptic) one to 
two weeks apart and looked for anything that shifted against the backdrop of stars. 
This systematic approach was successful and Pluto was discovered by this young (born 
4 Feb 1906) 24 year old Kansas lab assistant on February 18, 1930. Pluto is actually 
too small to be the &quot;Planet X&quot; Percival Lowell had hoped to find. Pluto&#39;s was a 
serendipitous discovery. <a NAME="stats"></a></p>

<b>Pluto &amp; Charon</b> <br>
This view of Pluto was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It shows a rare image 
of tiny Pluto with its moon Charon, which is slightly smaller than the planet. Because 
Pluto has not yet been visited by any spacecraft, it remains a mysterious planet. 
Due to its great distance from the sun, Pluto&#39;s surface is believed to reach temperatures 
as low as -240°C (-400°F). From Pluto&#39;s surface, the Sun appears as only a very 
bright star. <i>(Courtesy NASA)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Hubble Telescope Image</b> <br>
This is the clearest view yet of the distant planet Pluto and its moon, Charon, 
as revealed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The image was taken on February 
21, 1994, when the planet was 4.4 billion kilometers (2.7 billion miles) from the 
Earth. </p>
<p>The HST corrected optics show the two objects as clearly separate and sharp disks. 
This now allows astronomers to measure directly (to within about 1 percent) Pluto&#39;s 
diameter of 2,320 kilometers (1,440 miles) and Charon&#39;s diameter of 1,270 kilometers 
(790 miles). </p>
<p>The HST observations show that Charon is bluer than Pluto. This means that the 
worlds have different surface composition and structure. A bright highlight on Pluto 
indicates that it might have a smoothly reflecting surface layer. A detailed analysis 
of the HST image also suggests that there is a bright area parallel to the equator 
of Pluto. However, subsequent observations are needed to confirm that this feature 
is real. The new HST image was taken when Charon was near its maximum elongation 
from Pluto (0.9 arcseconds). The two worlds are 19,640 kilometers (12,200 miles) 
apart. <i>(Courtesy NASA/ESA/ESO)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>The Surface of Pluto</b> <br>
The never-before-seen surface of the distant planet Pluto is resolved in these NASA 
Hubble Space Telescope pictures. These images, which were made in blue light, show 
that Pluto is an unusually complex object, with more large-scale contrast than any 
planet, except Earth. Pluto probably shows even more contrast and perhaps sharper 
boundaries between light and dark areas than is shown here, but Hubble&#39;s resolution 
(just like early telescopic views of Mars) tends to blur edges and blend together 
small features sitting inside larger ones. </p>
<p>The two smaller inset pictures at the top are actual images from Hubble. North 
is up. Each square pixel (picture element) is more than 100 miles across. At this 
resolution, Hubble discerns roughly 12 major &quot;regions&quot; where the surface is either 
bright or dark. The larger images (bottom) are from a global map constructed through 
computer image processing performed on the Hubble data. Opposite hemispheres of 
Pluto are seen in these two views. <i>(Courtesy NASA/ESA/ESO)</i>

<b>Pluto, Charon, and USA Comparison</b> <br>
This image shows the approximate size of Pluto and Charon by overlaying them on 
an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) image of the United States of 
America. Pluto is about 2274 kilometers (1410 miles) in diameter and Charon 1172 
kilometers (727 miles) in diameter. The image of Pluto is based upon Hubble observations 
taken of Pluto in June and July of 1994. The Charon image is based upon photometric 
measurements acquired by Marc Buie of Lowell Observatory. <i>(Copyright 1998 by

<b>Map of the Surface of Pluto</b> <br>
This is the first image-based surface map of the solar system&#39;s most remote planet, 
Pluto. The map, which covers 85% of the planet&#39;s surface, confirms that Pluto has 
a dark equatorial belt and bright polar caps, as inferred from ground-based light 
curves obtained during the mutual eclipses that occurred between Pluto and its satellite 
Charon in the late 1980s. </p>
<p>The brightness variations in this map may be due to topographic features such 
as basins and fresh impact craters. However, most of the surface features are likely 
produced by the complex distribution of frosts that migrate across Pluto&#39;s surface 
with its orbital and seasonal cycles and chemical byproducts deposited out of Pluto&#39;s 
nitrogen-methane atmosphere. Names may later be proposed for some of the larger 
regions. </p>
<p>Image reconstruction techniques smooth out the coarse pixels in the four raw 
images to reveal major regions where the surface is either bright or dark. The black 
strip across the bottom corresponds to the region surrounding Pluto&#39;s south pole, 
which was pointed away from Earth when the observations were made, and could not 
be imaged. <i>(Courtesy NASA/ESA/ESO)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">
