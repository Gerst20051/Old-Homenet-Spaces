<h2 align="center">Ten Tips on Preparing for a Job Interview</h2>
<p>Your hard work sending out all those cover letters and résumés has finally paid 
off -- you&#39;ve been called in for a face-to-face job interview. Congratulations! 
But now is not the time to sit back and think about how you&#39;re going to spend your 
fat new salary; you&#39;ve got a lot of work to do. The better prepared you are beforehand, 
the better your chances are of walking out of the interview with a confident smile 
on your face that says &quot;I think I got the job!&quot;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that in the competitive business world, there are sure to be dozens 
of other highly qualified candidates going after <i>your</i> job. It&#39;s important 
to make yourself stand out as someone special. Now is the time to practice exactly 
how you will sell yourself to a prospective employer during that crucial first meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are 10 important tips to help your next interview lead to your next job:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Do your homework.</strong> Research the company beforehand so that 
you can showcase that knowledge during the interview. This will boost your credibility 
with the interviewer and will help you to formulate intelligent questions to ask 
him or her.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Know where you&#39;re going.</strong> Make sure to find out where the 
office is and how to get there. Do you know how long the trip will take? Do you 
have the name and phone number of the person you&#39;ll be meeting with? Do you know 
how easy it is to park? Save yourself time and unnecessary stress by figuring these 
things out before heading to the interview.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Look the part.</strong> Your clothing should be neat, pressed, and 
professional looking. As it can be difficult to know the culture of the office environment 
beforehand, err on the side of conservative. Even if everyone&#39;s wearing jeans when 
you arrive, you&#39;re still probably better off having shown up in a suit. However, 
don&#39;t be afraid to inject some personality into your look, and don&#39;t neglect the 
details: make sure to have a fresh haircut and clean, manicured nails.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Rehearse beforehand.</strong> Prior to your interview, prepare answers 
to common questions the interviewer is likely to ask, such as <i>What are your strengths 
and weaknesses? Why do you want to work here? Why should we hire you?</i> and the 
ever popular <i>Tell me about yourself.</i> Conduct a mock interview with a trusted 
friend as practice.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Secure your references.</strong> Find at least three key people -- 
former supervisors, colleagues, or instructors -- who are willing to serve as your 
professional references. Be sure to secure their permission beforehand, and be certain 
that they will speak highly of you if contacted by a potential employer.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Arrive early.</strong> Be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes before 
the interview. Visit the restroom and check your appearance in the mirror. Announce 
yourself to the receptionist to let him or her know that you have arrived and that 
you have an appointment. Turn your cell phone off so it doesn&#39;t ring during your 
meeting.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Bring necessary documentation.</strong> Make a checklist of documents 
you will need for the interview and make sure you have them in your briefcase before 
leaving home. These documents may include extra copies of your résumé, a passport, 
driver&#39;s license, Social Security card, or portfolio of writing samples or other 
professional work. If you are a recent graduate, you should also bring along your 
college transcripts.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Sell yourself.</strong> The interview is your chance to shine, so 
now is not the time to be humble. Develop a 25-second sales pitch that sings your 
praises. In business this is called an &quot;elevator speech,&quot; a compelling overview 
of <i>why you?</i> that can be recited in the time it takes to ride the elevator. 
It should include your strengths, your abilities, and what sets you uniquely apart 
from other applicants.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Don&#39;t neglect to ask questions.</strong> Based on your earlier research, 
ask how the responsibilities of the open position relate to the company&#39;s goals 
and plans for the future. Interviewers are often favorably impressed by candidates 
who show they&#39;ve done their homework and are knowledgeable about the organization.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Follow up.</strong> After the interview, don&#39;t forget to send a handwritten 
note or friendly email thanking the interviewer for his or her time and consideration, 
as well as restating your interest and commitment to the position. If you don&#39;t 
hear anything after one week, call to politely inquire when they will be making 
a final decision.</p>
<p>Remember to keep this in mind: Every interview is a valuable learning experience. 
Even if you don&#39;t get this particular job, when the next interview rolls around, 
you&#39;ll be much better prepared and more at ease with the whole process. All of which 
can go a long way to boosting your confidence and improving your chances of being 
offered the next job. Good luck!</p>
