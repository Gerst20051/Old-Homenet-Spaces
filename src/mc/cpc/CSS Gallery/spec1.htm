    <p>Microsoft’s new Verdana typeface family consists of four TrueType fonts created 
    specifically to address the challenges of on-screen display. Designed by world 
    renowned type designer <a HREF="/typography/css/gallery/specmatt.htm">Matthew 
    Carter</a>, and hand-hinted by leading hinting expert, Monotype’s
    <a HREF="/typography/css/gallery/spectom.htm">Tom Rickner</a>, these sans serif 
    fonts are unique examples of type design for the computer screen. </p>
    <h2>The Design of Verdana</h2>
    <p>In its proportions and stroke weight, the Verdana family resembles sans serifs 
    such as Frutiger, and Johnston’s typeface for the London Underground. But to 
    label Verdana a humanist face is to ignore the successful fusion of form and 
    function Carter has achieved. This isn’t merely a revival of classical elegance 
    and savoir faire; this is type designed for the medium of screen. </p>
    <p>The Verdana fonts are stripped of features redundant when applied to the 
    screen. They exhibit new characteristics, derived from the pixel rather than 
    the pen, the brush or the chisel. The balance between straight, curve and diagonal 
    has been meticulously tuned to ensure that the pixel patterns at small sizes 
    are pleasing, clear and legible. Commonly confused characters, such as the lowercase 
    i j l, the upercase I J L and the number 1, have been carefully drawn for maximum 
    individuality – an important characteristic of fonts designed for on-screen 
    use. And the various weights have been designed to create sufficient contrast 
    from one another ensuring, for example, that the bold font is heavy enough even 
    at sizes as small as 8 ppem. </p>
    <p>Another reason for the legibility of these fonts on the screen is their generous 
    width and spacing. At low resolutions, because of the limited number of pixels, 
    letters cannot differ very much. But often the smallest differences can often 
    change the whole look of a page, or a screenful of type; a fact demonstrated 
    in the illustration below. <br>
    <br>
    <img SRC="../../../i/mc/cpc/Bottom%20Table/CSS%20Gallery/Verd%20Comp.gif" ALT="Verdana comparison" CLASS="pic" width="457" height="138">
    </p>
    <p>In the letters s a g – commonly critical, because they have more horizontal 
    lines – there is not an appreciable difference between the fonts. While it is 
    possible to prefer one of the ‘a’s to the others, the differences are only slight.
    </p>
    <p>What makes the last ‘quick brown fox’ easier to read is the looser letterspacing. 
    At eight points on the screen, the text in the other two fonts becomes too dark.
    </p>
    <p>Despite the quality of the Verdana font family at small sizes it is at higher 
    resolutions that they are best appreciated. In the words of Tom Rickner, “My 
    hope now is that these faces will be enjoyed beyond just the computer screen. 
    Although the screen size bitmaps were the most crucial in the production of 
    these fonts...[their] uses should not be limited to on screen typography.”

    sizes. <br>
