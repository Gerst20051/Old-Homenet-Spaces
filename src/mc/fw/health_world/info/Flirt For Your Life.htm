    To Flirt Success</u></strong></font><p><strong><u>
    <font color="#ff1493" size="4">He&#39;ll be like putty in your hands in no time, 
    girls...</font></u></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="deeppink">1. Don't Be Shy</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">Being shy is BAD when it comes to flirting. 
    If, like me, you&#39;re unbelievably shy and blush easily, be coy and cute. Hide 
    behind your hair. Giggle and fidget as if you&#39;re unsure. It makes &#39;em want to 
    protect you. Awwwww. If that&#39;s not you...be obvious (though don&#39;t 
    embarrass yourself)...because 
    boys just don&#39;t get subtle hints.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#ff1493">2. SMILE<img src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/All%20About%20Life%20And%20Boys/biggrin.gif" width="20" height="20"></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">You MUST flash him your most sexy smile. 
    &#39;Nuff said.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#ff1493">3. Flick and Touch your hair</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">Trust me ladies, this one works, but don&#39;t 
    do it all the time, he&#39;ll either think you a vain loony, or think you have nits. 
    You have to time it well.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#ff1493">4. Touch him.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">Not so obviously that he&#39;s freaked out, 
    please! Just a light brush on his arm. If you&#39;re meant to be 
    sympathizing with 
    him pat his hand. Ok?</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#ff1493">5. Don&#39;t Be Fierce, Be Feisty.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">I&#39;ve seen girls make this mistake over and 
    over again. If you&#39;re fierce, as in snappy, with him he&#39;ll think you hate him 
    and go running a mile. Feisty, however, will get him swooning. Show him you 
    can stand up for yourself. Show your drama-queen tendencies from time to time, 
    if you like that sort of thing. Boys like feisty ladies...think Charlie&#39;s Angels 
    or Lara Croft.</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#ff1493">6. Be Sexy</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">Don&#39;t worry if chopping off your own head 
    is preferable to going out in a mini-skirt and crop top. Hardly any of us have 
    the confidence (and the looks) to do that kind of thing, and it can look 
    tartly 
    anyway. Show YOUR personal assets. Don&#39;t go out in a low-cut, bust-showing top 
    if you have AA boobs. You get the general idea. Confidence is sexiness. Walk 
    and talk in a confident, smooth way and you&#39;ll be oozing sex appeal. ZING!</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#ff1493">7. Tease Him</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="darkorchid">Not horribly, obviously, but in a flirty 
    way. The boys love that, take it from me</font></strong></font></p>
