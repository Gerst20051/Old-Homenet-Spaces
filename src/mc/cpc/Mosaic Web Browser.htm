  <h3>In the beginning there was NCSA Mosaic....</h3>
  <h3>Version 0.1a</h3>
  <p><i>Development began in June 1993 - Internal testing Only</i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Native support for accessing documents and data using World Wide Web, gopher, 
    Anonymous FTP, and NNTP (Usenet News) protocols. Support for archie, finger, 
    whois, and Veronica (as well as others) through gateways. </li>
    <li>Full HTML display </li>
    <li>Support for inlined GIF images in HTML hypertext documents </li>
    <li>Internal sound support for Sun/NeXT/DEC .AU audio files </li>
    <li>Support for GIF, JPEG, MPEG, QuickTime for Windows, Microsoft Video for 
    Windows, Postcript and other documents via forking to appropriate viewers (user 
    configurable) </li>
    <li>Full hypertext support, including using inlined images as anchors </li>
    <li>Optional toolbar with shortcut buttons </li>
    <li>Optional status bar to display hyperlink destinations </li>
    <li>Local History </li>
    <li>Fully customizable font selection </li>
    <li>Savable preferences, including window size and position </li>
    <li>Minimal Hotlist </li>
    <li>Scrolling for large documents </li>
    <li>Status of loading/decoding shown in status bar </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 0.2a</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed some memory leaks </li>
    <li>Now works with Winsock 1.1 compliant DLLs </li>
    <li>Local file support </li>
    <li>User configurable hotlist </li>
    <li>Ability to add current document to hotlist </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 0.3a</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug which would cause a GPF upon exiting </li>
    <li>Fixed a number of memory holes which would lead to GPF&#39;s and quickly running 
    out of available resources. (although some probably still remain). </li>
    <li>Binary Transfer Mode. </li>
    <li>Support for Inlined X-Bitmaps </li>
    <li>Configuration option to automatically load a home page. </li>
    <li>User configurable menus </li>
    <li>Internal support for AIFF audio files </li>
    <li>Fixed bug which would cause a crash if an inlined image was missing </li>
    <li>Fixed strange bug which resulted &#39;y with quotation mark&#39; characters </li>
    <li>Added ability to perform remote search (still has a bug...see below)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 0.4a</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Null chunk bug has been fixed! You should no longer see Mosaic dropping 
    parts of a document. </li>
    <li>Problems with anchors on left edge of the window have been fixed. </li>
    <li>GPF when choosing &quot;Add Current to Hotlist&quot; with no document loaded has been 
    fixed. </li>
    <li>Anchors in preformatted text now work correctly. </li>
    <li>The new line break tag (&lt;BR&gt;) has been implemented. </li>
    <li>Description lists display correctly. </li>
    <li>Lists can now be nested to arbitrary depth. </li>
    <li>The bold (&lt;B&gt;) and italics (&lt;I&gt;) tags now work. </li>
    <li>We now try to load an image several times before we give up on it. This 
    is actually a little annoying on documents that have missing images (such as 
    some of the Vatican Exhibit docs), but I&#39;m working on fixing that. </li>
    <li>Mosaic for Windows calls WSACleanup to clean up the sockets library. This 
    may temporarily cause a problem for people using our library - Windows will 
    give the message &quot;Application Error - Call to Undefined Dynalink&quot; when you try 
    to exit. Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ll get around to fixing it. </li>
    <li>Lastly, the fix to the bug that was wiping out chunks of a document seems 
    to have improved the GPF&#39;ing. However, it still crashes every once in a while, 
    and it still seems to be a much more frequent occurence in the non-debugging 
    version of the program. *sigh*. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 0.5a</h3>
  <p><i>Released Sept. 16, 1993</i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Image cacheing within document - no more multiple loads of images when they 
    are used multiple times in a document. </li>
    <li><b>MUCH</b> faster scrolling, due to smarter drawing function. <i>This introduced 
    an as-yet-unfixed redrawing bug while scrolling in a document that has inlined 
    images.</i> </li>
    <li>This seems to alleviated the problem with documents being visually mangled 
    when loaded while not scrolled to the top. </li>
    <li>Bug with removing spaces in Gopher, News, and FTP is fixed. </li>
    <li>Internal anchors - i.e., hyperlinks to anchors within a document - work 
    now, complete with scrolling to the correct location. </li>
    <li>File Typing (i.e. HTML vs plaintext) is done more intelligently. </li>
    <li>Home Page button and Menu option work now, loading whatever document is 
    set up as &quot;URL0&quot; in WMOSAIC.INI. </li>
    <li>Open Local capability - use standard file dialog to open files on local 
    disk. </li>
    <li>Drag and Drop local file capability </li>
    <li>Drag and Drop file to annotation window </li>
    <li>Image retry is smarter - knows when it failed to connect vs when server 
    returned an error. </li>
    <li>Find/Find Next (searching within a document) </li>
    <li>The white strip that was showing up in the Fast and Error bitmaps when they 
    were hyperlinks is gone. </li>
    <li>Spaces are now stripped out at the beginning of list indices and paragraphs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 0.6b</h3>
  <p><i>First beta release - September 28, 1993</i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Try out the brand-new &quot;Mail to Developers&quot; option under the Help menu!! 
    This lets you send email to the developers straight from your PC. Be sure to 
    set up your email address in WMOSAIC.INI. </li>
    <li>The ISMAP image attribute is supported!! For a demo of this, take a look 
    at the <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/expo_map.html">Expo</a>.
    </li>
    <li>History Window is now fixed - &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Forward&quot; work correctly. </li>
    <li>&quot;Display Inlined Images&quot; option is now complete - shut this off to not transfer 
    inlined images (lots faster for people running over a slow net connection). 
    Press the left mouse button to traverse a hyperlink, press the right mouse button 
    to load an unloaded inline image. </li>
    <li>The new horizontal rule tag (&lt;HR&gt;) has been implemented. </li>
    <li>Local directory browsing works now. Try <a href="file:///c|/">this.</a>
    </li>
    <li>The messed-up MPEG and JPEG extensions are fixed, and configureable.
    </li>
    <li>Options for changing anchor color and <b>underlining anchors</b>. </li>
    <li>Completely configureable MIME-style extension typing and presentation (See 
    installation documentation for details.) </li>
    <li>Drive specifiers have been added to local file URLs. </li>
    <li>&quot;DELETE : command not found&quot; error after loading GIF, etc., is gone.
    </li>
    <li>Personal Annotations are much more robust now. </li>
    <li>Scrolling via keys is now supported. </li>
    <li>ISO characters should work now, if specified by the correct HTML, like so: 
    &quot;Sein -- das ist der Paß für die Ewigkeit.&quot; (aus <b>Die Grössere Hoffnung</b> 
    von Ilse Aichinger.) </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 0.7b</h3>
  <p><i>Released October 17,1993</i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A MAJOR memory drain is plugged... you can now use Mosaic for a LOOOOOONG 
    time without running out of memory (hopefully!). </li>
    <li>DOCUMENT caching is now supported! You can cache by number of documents 
    (stable) or amount of memory (NOT stable). </li>
    <li>The Search feature works again! </li>
    <li>Windows Mosaic is now HTTP/1.0 compliant. </li>
    <li>If HTTP accesses didn&#39;t work for you, but Gopher and FTP did, it should 
    now. (This was the case running under Windows NT.) </li>
    <li>Mail To Developers window now resizes correctly. </li>
    <li>The SMTP/Mail host is now configureable. </li>
    <li>The history is fixed - no more Assertion Failed messages from Back&amp;Forward 
    buttons. </li>
    <li>WinMosaic no longer attempts to MIME-type files transferred in binary mode.
    </li>
    <li>URLs which contain IP numbers no longer cause GPFs. </li>
    <li>Documents without titles no longer have the last document&#39;s title in the 
    title bar. </li>
    <li>The background color can be set to white instead of grey. </li>
    <li>The underlining/anchor bug seen on the Mosaic demo page is fixed. </li>
    <li>The problem with menu items on Menu 8 being mapped to Menu 2 is fixed.
    </li>
    <li>Temporary file names are chosen more intelligently (attempts to use the 
    source file&#39;s name.) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Version 1.0</h3>
  <p><i>Released Nov 11, 1993</i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The scrolling bug is fixed. You shouldn&#39;t see the screen mess up due to 
    images or large text in the document anymore. </li>
    <li>Network I/O is now (somewhat) <b>interruptable</b>. Click on the big Mosaic 
    icon in the upper-right corner to kill a net transfer. </li>
    <li>Also, quitting Mosaic forces a kill of any net transfers in progress. This 
    means the &quot;Can&#39;t run two instances of the same program&quot; error message shouldn&#39;t 
    appear anymore (although this feature is still a bit buggy.) </li>
    <li>Images can now be alligned middle, top, or bottom, instead of just top. 
    Considering that the default is bottom, and we only did top before, I was pretty 
    surprised that no-one mentioned this anomaly throughout all our beta testing.
    </li>
    <li>News articles are now readable (i.e., not all on one line.) </li>
    <li>URL redirection (a feature of HTTP 1.0) is now supported. </li>
    <li>Home Page loading is fixed. </li>
    <li>If you were having problems with the first document you tried never loading, 
    but subsequent ones working fine, that&#39;s fixed. </li>
    <li>Title and URL boxes are redrawn at the correct time now. </li>
    <li>Back &amp; Forward Assertion Failed errors are gone. </li>
    <li>Telnet executable (used for telnet:// URLs) is now configureable - see &quot;telnet=&quot; 
    under the Viewers section of the INI file. </li>
    <li>FTP error messages are now returned to the user. </li>
    <li>FTP logins now use your email address when logging in (this fixes a connect 
    problem the CERN LibWWW was creating. </li>
    <li>You can log in to a NON-anonymous FTP via the following method: set the 
    URL to be FILE://username@machine/pathname. For example, to log in as user &quot;jdoe&quot; 
    to FTP site &quot;ftp.yoyodyne.com&quot;, in the &quot;/usr/jdoe&quot; directory, give the URL: 
    &quot;file://jdoe@ftp.yoyodyne.com/usr/jdoe&quot; Mosaic will pop up a dialog box, asking 
    to confirm the username and give your password. <b>Your password is maintained 
    within Mosaic until you quit. Do <i>NOT</i> use this feature if you are security-paranoid.</b>
    </li>
    <li>Gopher and FTP now use pretty icons for files/directories/etc, and FTP shows 
    the file sizes. </li>
    <li>New set of Configured Menus, with all kinds of pointers. </li>
    <li>Horizontal rules are prettier now. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.0alpha1</h3>
  <p><i>Released Jan 31, 1994</i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML+ Forms are now supported! This is not quite finished, but definitely 
    well into the useful stage. </li>
    <dd>- Nasty problem with local file support fixed.
    <li>There is now an environment variable for the location of the MOSAIC.INI 
    file. To use this, put a line like the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    <pre>                SET MOSAIC.INI=C:\MISC\MY_MOS.INI</pre>
    </li>
    <li>XBMs are now written as 1 bit bitmaps. This means Mosaic now works in 24-bit 
    and 16-bit video modes. </li>
    <li>Better error reporting (explanatory text instead of numbers.) </li>
    <li>Cursor now behaves itself - hourglass cursor only appears during transfers 
    when cursor is in window, and doesn&#39;t flash. </li>
    <li>Horizontal rules no longer disappear. </li>
    <li>URL/Title text overwriting boxes now fixed. </li>
    <li>FTP is now much more stable. </li>
    <li>Anchors in &quot;pre&quot; formatted text bug fixed. </li>
    <li>Mosaic now supports a command-line parameter for URLs and local files (it 
    discriminates between a pathname like C:\TMP\TEST.HTML and a URL like file:///C|/TMP/TEST.HTML.)
    </li>
    <li>Inlined images are now cached across documents - if an image is in a previous 
    document, it won&#39;t be reloaded from the net. </li>
    <li>Blank lines in &quot;pre&quot; formatted text now appear correctly. </li>
    <li>Occasional blank white (! Not grey!) chunks fixed. </li>
    <li>Changing font forces a redraw. </li>
    <li>GDI Resource leaks plugged. </li>
    <li>disappearing text blocks bug fixed. </li>
    </dd>
  </ul>

    <li>DNS cacheing </li>
    <li>faster GIF decoding </li>
    <li>URLs missing trailing slash (e.g. &quot;http://cs.indiana.edu&quot;) now have correct 
    relative urls. </li>
    <li>Several FORMs bugs fixed </li>
    <li>Added linebreak after end of form </li>

    <li>Bug with deeply nested tags fixed </li>
    <li>&quot;-i inifile&quot; command-line option for INI file location. </li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.0alpha4</h3>
  <p><i>Released April 14, 1994</i><br>
  <b>Bugs Fixed:</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>News:URLs. </li>
    <li>underline anchor. </li>
    <li>resizing w/o a file. </li>
    <li>Scrolling ISINDEX docs. </li>
    <li>Updating problems of the NCSA icon. </li>
    <li>The problem with view source on cached docs. </li>
    <li>The lost slash bug (the Temp files under Win31.) </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.0alpha5</h3>
  <p><i>Released June 24, 1994</i><br>
  <b>Bugs Fixed</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>There were two large memory leaks which occurred whenever an inline image 
    was decoded and displayed. These leaks were approx. 1,000 bytes each. </li>
    <li>The document view window was being drawn incorrectly whenever the user was 
    at the bottom of a document, and Mosaic was re-sized. </li>
    <li>XBM images are now properly read and do not result in an ERROR graphic.
    </li>
    <li>XBM images used to require a LARGE amount of time to decode. The code was 
    re-written and now .xbm&#39;s decode approximately 100 times faster. </li>
    <li>The Printing bugs; large files, images, bold text, .txt files. </li>
    <li>Some minor problems with dialog boxes were fixed. </li>
    <li>The CRASH caused by incorrect HTML, &lt; dt &gt; and &lt; dd &gt; tags without the &lt; 
    dl &gt; tag, was corrected. Mosaic is a little more forgiving, but not much. ;^)
    </li>
    <li>The navigate back should now take you back to the last document viewed. 
    Previously, Mosaic did not update the history when users accessed documents 
    that were cached. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Enhancements</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is now possible to enter a URL directly to the Document URL line. Select 
    the Document URL line, enter the URL and press return to open the desired URL.
    </li>
    <li>The Vertical Scroll Bar is currently a permanent fixture on the document 
    view window. This eliminates an extra screen redraw which would occur whenever 
    the user went from a short document (less than one screenful) to a long document 
    or vice versa. Ideally we&#39;d like the vertical scroll bar to be dynamic without 
    the extra redraws, but this will improve things for now. </li>
    <li>The buttons on the button bar are now in color. </li>
    <li>The &quot;FIND&quot; button was redrawn with a more intuitive picture. It used to 
    look like a thermometer and may have lead people to believe it was for the hotlist.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.0alpha 6</h3>
  <p><i>Released July 27, 1994</i><br>
  <b>Bug Fixes</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>This latest release has focused on speed and memory issues. Our next release, 
    alpha 7, will address many of the bugs which you have reported to us. The following 
    bugs have been fixed in alpha 6: </li>
    <li>The loading of local URLs should no longer produce DNS Lookup failures.
    </li>
    <li>The loading of local images and sound files no longer deletes the file.
    </li>
    <li>The loading of images now shows the transfer progress. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Added Features</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A face lift </li>
    <li>Speed </li>
    <li>Kiosk Mosaic </li>
    <li>Additional Help </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.0 alpha 7</h3>
  <p><i>Released Sep 7, 1994</i><br>
  <b>Bug Fixes</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Local files are no longer deleted. </li>
    <li>Local files are no longer duplicated. </li>
    <li>file:// = ftp:// (Alpha 6 locked file:// for local files and ftp:// for 
    remote files. However, due to the large number of existing files that were written 
    using the old definition of file://, we had to revert back to file:// = ftp://. 
    Thus, file:///c| MUST be used to access local files.) </li>
    <li>Image alignment problem. Inline images align horizontally. </li>
    <li>The -i option was fixed. (-i allows the user to use the mosaic.ini that 
    is explicitly defined. ie. mosaic.exe -i c:\ncsa\mosaic.ini) </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Added Features</b> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The save, save as function. Save and Save as will save the current document 
    to your local disk. </li>
    <li>Animated Icon Change. We&#39;ve changed the size of the icon to be relative 
    to the amount of space that is available in the window. ie. If you use both 
    the tool bar and the Show Current URL functions, you will have a full-size animated 
    icon. If you choose not to use either of these functions, the icon will be reduced 
    in size to fit in the available space. </li>
    <li>Tool tips were added. Tool tips offers the user information about the current 
    tool the mouse cursor is pointing at in the Tool bar. </li>
    <li>The find icon on the Tool bar has changed from the list icon to a binocular 
    icon. </li>
    <li>We&#39;ve removed the &quot;URL&quot; title from the &quot;Show Current URL&quot; </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Version 2.0 Alpha 8</h3>

    </dl>
    </li>
    <li>Mosaic supports inline Transparent Gifs. </li>
    <li>The NCSA Mosaic logo has a new look. </li>
    <li>Mosaic will use the Temp directory as defined in your autoexec.bat file.
    </li>
    <li>The way Mosaic displays data has improved significantly. </li>
    <li>Mosaic is more forgiving about bad html. It shouldn&#39;t crash if it encounters 
    bad html. </li>
    <li>Forms: input controls of TYPE=Image are supported </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Bug Fixes</b> </p>
  <ul>
