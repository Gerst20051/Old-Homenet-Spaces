  <pre>Oh, say can you see by the dawn&#39;s early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#39;s last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,
O&#39;er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket&#39;s red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave?


On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe&#39;s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o&#39;er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning&#39;s first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
&#39;Tis the star-spangled banner!  Oh long may it wave
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave!


And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle&#39;s confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps&#39; pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave!


Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved home and the war&#39;s desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav&#39;n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto:  &quot;In God is our trust.&quot;
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
