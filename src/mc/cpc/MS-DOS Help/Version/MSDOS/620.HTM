    <p>Welcome to Microsoft MS-DOS, the most widely used operating
    system for personal computers. MS-DOS 6.2 improves on the safety
    and ease of use provided by MS-DOS 6. The rest of this topic
    describes features new to MS-DOS 6.2. For information about
    features included in both MS-DOS 6 and MS-DOS 6.2, see the Welcome
    chapter of the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>MS-DOS 6.2 includes
      <a href="../../Command/S/SCANDISK.HTM">SCANDISK</a>,
      a new utility that detects, diagnoses, and repairs disk errors
      on uncompressed drives and DoubleSpace compressed drives.
      <a href="../../Command/S/SCANDISK.HTM">SCANDISK</a>
      can repair file system errors (such as crosslinks and lost
      clusters) and physical disk errors. ScanDisk keeps a log of
      its repairs and enables you to undo any of the changes it
      made. DoubleSpace runs
      <a href="../../Command/S/SCANDISK.HTM">SCANDISK</a> to check
      the reliability of your disk before it begins compression.
      You can also run
      <a href="../../Command/S/SCANDISK.HTM">SCANDISK</a> yourself
      by typing <a href="../../Command/S/SCANDISK.HTM">SCANDISK</a>
      at the command prompt. For more information, see
      <a href="../../Command/S/SCANDISK.HTM#Introduction">An Introduction to ScanDisk</a>.</li>
      <li>DoubleSpace includes DoubleGuard safety checking, which
      protects against data corruption by verifying data integrity
      before writing data to your disk. If DoubleGuard detects that the
      memory DoubleSpace is using has been corrupted by another
      program, it shuts down your computer immediately to minimize
      damage to your data.
      <br>
      <br>Although DoubleGuard is on by default, you can turn it
      off to save memory. To do this, use the
      <a href="../../Command/D/DBLSPACE.HTM">DBLSPACE</a>
      <a href="../../Command/D/DBLSPACE.HTM#SwitchDoubleguard">/DOUBLEGUARD</a>
      command, or turn off the DoubleGuard option in the Options dialog
      (start DoubleSpace, and then choose Options from the Tools
      menu).</li>
      <li>The MS-DOS extended-memory manager, <a href="../../Command/H/HIMEMSYS.HTM">HIMEM.SYS</a>, automatically
      tests your system's memory when you start your computer. This
      test can identify memory chips that are no longer reliable.
      (Unreliable memory can result in system instability or loss of
      data.) To turn off the memory test, add the
      <a href="../../Command/H/HIMEMSYS.HTM#SwitchTestmem">/TESTMEM:OFF</a> switch
      to the command that starts <a href="../../Command/H/HIMEMSYS.HTM">HIMEM.SYS</a>. For more information, see
      <a href="../../Command/H/HIMEMSYS.HTM">HIMEM.SYS</a>.</li>
      <li>Setup now configures <a href="../../Command/S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> as a read-only cache by
      default. Even if write-caching is enabled, MS-DOS does not
      display the command prompt until SMARTDrive has written its cache
      to your disk. This prevents you from turning off your computer
      before the data in memory is saved.</li>
      <li>The <a href="../../Command/M/MOVE.HTM">MOVE</a>,
      <a href="../../Command/C/COPY.HTM">COPY</a>, and
      <a href="../../Command/X/XCOPY.HTM">XCOPY</a> commands
      now ask you for confirmation before copying a file over another
      file that has the same name. (However, when issued from a batch
      file, these commands do not prompt for confirmation before
      overwriting a file.)</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="Ease"></a> <b>Ease-of-Use Features and Other Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>With MS-DOS 6.2, you can easily uncompress a DoubleSpace
      drive or even completely uninstall DoubleSpace from memory. For
      more information, see
      <a href="../../Command/D/DBLSPACE.HTM">DBLSPACE</a>
      <a href="../../Command/D/DBLSPACE.HTM#SwitchUncompress">/UNCOMPRESS</a>.</li>
      <li>SMARTDrive now caches CD-ROM drives. (For this support to be
      enabled, the
      <a href="../../Command/M/MSCDEX.HTM">MSCDEX</a> program must be
      loaded before SMARTDrive. To find out if SMARTDrive is caching
      your CD-ROM drive, type
      <a href="../../Command/S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDRV</a>
      at the command prompt. If
      <a href="../../Command/S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDRV</a>
      lists the drive letter for your CD-ROM drive, the drive is
      being cached. For more information, see
      <a href="../../Command/S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDRV</a>.</li>
      <li>DoubleSpace automatically mounts compressed floppy disks and
      other compressed removable media - even when Windows
      is running. Although automounting is enabled by default, you can
      turn it off to save memory. To do this, use the
      <a href="../../Command/D/DBLSPACE.HTM">DBLSPACE</a>
      <a href="../../Command/D/DBLSPACE.HTM#SwitchAutomount">/AUTOMOUNT</a>
      command, or turn off the Automount option in the
      Options dialog (start DoubleSpace, and then choose Options from
      the Tools menu).</li>
      <li>You can now bypass or carry out individual commands in your
      AUTOEXEC.BAT and other batch programs. (In MS-DOS 6, this
      capability was limited to your CONFIG.SYS file.) This feature
      makes it easier to isolate problems when you are troubleshooting
      problems in your system configuration or in batch programs.</li>
      <li>To step through the commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, press
      F8 when your computer starts. For more information, see
      "Bypassing CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Commands" in the
      CONFIG.SYS Commands topic. To step through other batch
      files, use the
      <a href="../../Command/C/COMMAND.HTM">COMMAND</a>
      <a href="../../Command/C/COMMAND.HTM#SwitchY">/Y</a>
      command.</li>
      <li>If you need to, you can bypass DoubleSpace when you start
      your computer. This makes troubleshooting easier and also
      temporarily frees memory for use by other applications. For more
      information, see "Bypassing DoubleSpace" in the CONFIG.SYS
      Commands topic.</li>
      <li>The
      <a href="../../Command/D/DISKCOPY.HTM">DISKCOPY</a>
      command now uses your hard disk as an
      interim storage area, which makes copying from one floppy disk to
      another faster and easier (makes floppy in a single pass) and
      can make multiple copies of the same original.</li>
      <li>Microsoft Defragmenter makes better use of your computer's
      extended memory, so it can now defragment much larger disks and
      disks containing many more files and directories. For more
      information on running Defragmenter, see the
      <a href="../../Command/D/DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a> command.</li>
      <li>The output of the
      <a href="../../Command/D/DIR.HTM">DIR</a>,
      <a href="../../Command/M/MEM.HTM">MEM</a>,
      <a href="../../Command/C/CHKDSK.HTM">CHKDSK</a>, and
      <a href="../../Command/F/FORMAT.HTM">FORMAT</a> commands is
      much easier to read, since it now includes thousands separators
      when displaying numbers greater than 999. For example, "1000000
      bytes free" now reads "1,000,000 bytes free."</li>
