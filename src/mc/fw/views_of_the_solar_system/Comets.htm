<!-- INBODYEND -->Comets are small, fragile, irregularly shaped bodies composed 
of a mixture of non-volatile grains and frozen gases. They have highly elliptical 
orbits that bring them very close to the Sun and swing them deeply into space, often 
beyond the orbit of Pluto.
<p>Comet structures are diverse and very dynamic, but they all develop a surrounding 
cloud of diffuse material, called a coma, that usually grows in size and brightness 
as the comet approaches the Sun. Usually a small, bright nucleus (less than 10 km 
in diameter) is visible in the middle of the coma. The coma and the nucleus together 
constitute the head of the comet. </p>

<p>As comets approach the Sun they develop enormous tails of luminous material that 
extend for millions of kilometers from the head, away from the Sun. When far from 
the Sun, the nucleus is very cold and its material is frozen solid within the nucleus. 
In this state comets are sometimes referred to as a &quot;dirty iceberg&quot; or &quot;dirty snowball,&quot; 
since over half of their material is ice. When a comet approaches within a few
<a HREF="terms.htm#astunit">AU</a> of the Sun, the surface of the nucleus begins 
to warm, and volatiles evaporate. The evaporated molecules boil off and carry small 
solid particles with them, forming the comet&#39;s coma of gas and dust. </p>
<p>When the nucleus is frozen, it can be seen only by reflected sunlight. However, 
when a coma develops, dust reflects still more sunlight, and gas in the coma absorbs 
ultraviolet radiation and begins to fluoresce. At about 5 AU from the Sun, fluorescence 
usually becomes more intense than reflected light. </p>
<p>As the comet absorbs ultraviolet light, chemical processes release hydrogen, 
which escapes the comet&#39;s gravity, and forms a hydrogen envelope. This envelope 
cannot be seen from Earth because its light is absorbed by our atmosphere, but it 
has been detected by spacecraft. </p>
<p>The Sun&#39;s radiation pressure and solar wind accelerate materials away from the 
comet&#39;s head at differing velocities according to the size and mass of the materials. 
Thus, relatively massive dust tails are accelerated slowly and tend to be curved. 
The ion tail is much less massive, and is accelerated so greatly that it appears 
as a nearly straight line extending away from the comet opposite the Sun. The following 
view of Comet West shows two distinct tails. The thin blue
<a HREF="terms.htm#plasma">plasma</a> tail is made up of gases and the broad white 
tail is made up of microscopic dust particles. </p>

<b>Comet West</b> </center>
<p>Each time a comet visits the Sun, it loses some of its volatiles. Eventually, 
it becomes just another rocky mass in the solar system. For this reason, comets 
are said to be short-lived, on a cosmological time scale. Many scientists believe 
that some <a HREF="Asteroids.htm">asteroids</a> are extinct comet nuclei, comets 
that have lost all of their volatiles. </p>

<a NAME="hyakutake"><b>Comet Hyakutake</b></a> <br>
These Hubble Space Telescope images of comet Hyakutake were taken on March 25, 1996 
when the comet passed at a distance of 9.3 million miles from
<a HREF="earth.htm">Earth</a>. These images focus on a very small region near the 
heart of the comet, the icy, solid nucleus and provide an exceptionally clear view 
of the near-nucleus region of the comet. </p>
<p>The left image is 2070 miles across (3340 km) and shows that most of the dust 
is being produced on the sunward-facing hemisphere of the comet. Also at upper left 
are three small pieces which have broken off the comet and are forming their own 
tails. Icy regions on the nucleus are activated as they rotate into sunlight, ejecting 
large amounts of dust in the jets that are faintly visible in this image. Sunlight 
striking this dust eventually turns it around and &quot;blows&quot; it into the tailward hemisphere.
</p>
<p>The bottom-right image is an expanded view of the near-nucleus region and is 
only 470 miles (760 km) across. The nucleus is near the center of the frame, but 
the brightest area is probably the tip of the strongest dust jet rather than the 
nucleus itself. Presumably, the nucleus surface lies just below this bright jet. 
The top-right image shows pieces of the nucleus that apparently broke off. The image 
shows at least three separate objects that are probably made up of coarse-grained 
dust. Large fragments of the nucleus would not be accelerated into the tail, which 
appears to be the case in this image. <i>(Credit: H. A. Weaver--Applied Research

<b>First X-Rays From Comet Hyakutake Discovered</b> <br>
This image shows the discovery of a strong X-ray radiation signal coming from comet 
Hyakutake. The image was made on March 27, 1996 using Germany&#39;s orbiting ROSAT satellite. 
The comet was near its closest approach to the Earth at a distance of less than 
10 million miles when X-ray emmisions were first detected by ROSAT. The strength 
and rapid changes in intensity of the comet&#39;s X-ray emission both surprised and 
puzzled astronomers. &quot;We had no clear expectation that comets shine in X-rays,&quot; 
said Dr. Michael J. Mumma of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. 
X-rays have never been found from a comet before, and scientists had optimistically 
predicted an intensity that turned out to be about 100 times weaker than the radiation 
actually detected by ROSAT. Strong changes in the brightness of the X-rays were 
another surprise. There were pronounced increases and decreases in the X-ray brightness 
from one ROSAT observation to another, typically over a time difference of a few 
hours. </p>
<p>Still another puzzle is the nature of the physical process that generates the 
X-rays, but the ROSAT image may contain clues to this process. In the image, the 
X-rays from the comet seem to come from a crescent-shaped region on the sunward 
side of Comet Hyakutake. One preliminary theory is that X-ray emission from the 
Sun was absorbed by a cloud of gaseous water molecules surrounding the nucleus of 
the comet, and then were re-emitted by the molecules in a process physicists call 
&quot;fluorescence.&quot; According to this idea, the cloud is so thick that its sunward side 
absorbs nearly all the incoming solar X-rays, so that none reach the remainder of 
the cloud. This could explain why the cometary X-ray emission has the form of a 
crescent, rather than that of a sphere around the nucleus. A second possible explanation 
is that the X-rays are produced from the violent collision between the comet material 
and the supersonic &quot;wind&quot; of plasma and particles streaming away from the Sun.

<b>Comet Hale-Bopp</b> <br>
These NASA Hubble Space Telescope pictures of comet Hale-Bopp show a remarkable 
&quot;pinwheel&quot; pattern and a blob of free-flying debris near the nucleus. The bright 
clump of light along the spiral (above the nucleus, which is near the center of 
the frame) may be a piece of the comet&#39;s icy crust that was ejected into space by 
a combination of ice evaporation and the comet&#39;s rotation, and which then disintegrated 
into a bright cloud of particles. </p>
<p>Although the &quot;blob&quot; is about 3.5 times fainter than the brightest portion at 
the nucleus, the lump appears brighter because it covers a larger area. The debris 
follows a spiral pattern outward because the solid nucleus is rotating like a lawn 
sprinkler, completing a single rotation about once per week. <br CLEAR="ALL">
