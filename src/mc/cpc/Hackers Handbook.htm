<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF"><i><b>Hack</b></i> 
is a term in the slang of the technology culture which has come into existence 
over the past few decades. As a noun, it has a number of related meanings; as a 
verb, it means creating or participating in a hack. </font> </p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">All of the modern meanings seem to be rooted in its 
widespread use as slang throughout Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 
starting in the 1960s. There, the original meaning of &quot;hack&quot; was an elaborate 
and flamboyant student prank; it was used with hacker, meaning &quot;one who perpetrates a hack&quot;. Past MIT hacks include:

<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Over time, the meaning of the word there was expanded, 
perhaps through contact with the ham radio community, which used it in something 
close to the following meanings. In any event, it came to mean either a kludge, 
or the opposite of a kludge, as in a clever or elegant solution to a difficult 
problem. In the term &quot;hack value&quot; it also acquired a meaning of anything that was simultaneously fun 
and clever. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The initial hacker community at MIT, particularly those 
associated with the Tech Model Railroad Club, applied this pre-existing local 
slang to computer programming, producing the variant which first came into 
common use outside MIT. A &quot;hack&quot; now meant a quick fix to a computer program 
problem, as in &quot;That hack you made last night to the editor is working well&quot;. A 
hacker came into the lexicon as meaning one who hacks, using this 
definition. The surface implication (which might be a modest mocking and play on 
the literary definition) was a casual attempt to fix the problem, but the deeper 
meaning was somethin</font>g more clever and thus impressive. </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">It was used especially among US university computing center 
staff, such as those at Stanford in the period beginning approximately in the 
mid-1960s. The context determined whether the complimentary or derogatory meanings was 
implied. Phrases such as &quot;ugly hack&quot; or &quot;quick hack&quot; generally referred to the 
latter meaning; phrases such as &quot;cool hack&quot; or &quot;neat hack&quot; referred to the 
former. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">In a similar vein, a &quot;hack&quot; may refer to works outside of 
computer programming. For example, a math hack means a clever solution to a 
mathematical problem. The GNU General Public License has been described as a
</font>
<a class="new" title="Copyright" href="http://www.hacking.teleactivities.net">
<font color="#FFFFFF">copyright</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"> hack because it cleverly uses the copyright laws for a purpose the 
lawmakers did not foresee. All of these uses now also seem to be spreading 
beyond MIT as well. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The term has since acquired an additional and now more common 
meaning, since approximately the 1980s; this more modern definition was 
initially associated with crackers. This growing use of the term &quot;hack&quot; is to 
refer to a program that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a 
computer game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to 
them. As an example of this use, for Palm OS users (until the 4th iteration of 
this operating system), a &quot;hack&quot; refers to an extension of the operating system 
which provides additional functionality. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes the jargon used by hackers is thought of as a 
language in its own right, called <b>hackish</b>. This should not be confused 
with &quot;1337&quot; or &quot;leetspeak.&quot; </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#FFFFFF">The term <i>hacking</i> is the act of constructing
furniture with an axe, which may have led to the computer-industry compliment of calling a 
programming effort a <i>hack</i>, although the etymology is more likely rooted 
in the MIT use.</font></p>
