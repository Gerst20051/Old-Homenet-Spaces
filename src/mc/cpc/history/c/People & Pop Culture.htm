          a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, enjoyed successful careers in academia, 
          business, and the military while making history in the computer field. 
          She helped program the Harvard Mark I and II and developed the first compiler, 
          A-0. Her subsequent work on programming languages led to COBOL, a language

          Time publisher John A. Meyers wrote, <i>&quot;Several human candidates might 
          have represented 1982, but none symbolized the past year more richly, 
          or will be viewed by history as more significant, than a machine: the

          <br>
          His magazine, he explained, has chronicled the change in public opinion 
          with regard to computers. A senior writer contributed: </i>&quot;computers 
          were once regarded as distant, ominous abstractions, like Big Brother. 
          In 1982, they truly became personalized, brought down to scale, so that 
          people could hold, prod and play with them.&quot;</i> At Time, the main writer 
          on the project completed his work on a typewriter, but Meyers noted that 
          the magazine&#39;s newsroom would upgrade to word processors within a year.
