			<p><strong><a name="ADJOURN">Adjournment</a></strong><br>
			adjourn <em>v.</em> 1. To suspend until a later stated time. [&lt;OFr.
			<em>ajourner</em>] <strong>adjournment <em>n.</em></strong></p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="APPELLATE">Appellate</a></strong><br>
			appellate <em>adj</em> having power to review decisions of lower courts</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="APPORTIONMENT">Apportionment</a></strong><br>
			apportion <em>v.</em> to distribute proportionately</p>
			<p>In the context of the Constitution, apportionment means that each 
			state gets a number appropriate to its population. For example, Representatives 
			are apportioned among the states, with the most populous getting the 
			greater share. Direct taxes (of which there are none today) were to 
			be charged to the states in this manner as well.</p>
			<p>The need for apportionment of taxes, and the reason for it, is difficult 
			for us to imagine today, but there were good reasons for it. The following 
			is an explanation of the need for the Direct Tax Apportionment clause. 
			It was written by Supreme Court Justice Paterson in <i>Hylton v US</i> 
			(3 US 171 [1796]):</p>
			<p><em>The constitution declares, that a capitation tax is a direct 
			tax; and both in theory and practice, a tax on land is deemed to be 
			a direct tax... The provision was made in favor of the southern states; 
			they possessed a large number of slaves; they had extensive tracts of 
			territory, thinly settled, and not very productive. A majority of the 
			states had but few slaves, and several of them a limited territory, 
			well settled, and in a high state of cultivation. The southern states, 
			if no provision had been introduced in the constitution, would have 
			been wholly at the mercy of the other states. Congress in such case, 
			might tax slaves, at discretion or arbitrarily, and land in every part 
			of the Union, after the same rate or measure: so much a head, in the 
			first instance, and so much an acre, in the second. To guard them against 
			imposition, in these particulars, was the reason of introducing the 
			clause in the constitution.</em></p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="ATTAINDER">Attainder</a></strong><br>
			attainder <em>n.</em> The loss of all civil rights by a person sentenced 
			for a serious crime. [&lt; OFr. <em>attaindre,</em> to convict]</p>
			<p>In the context of the Constitution, a Bill of Attainder is meant 
			to mean a bill that has a negative effect on a single person or group 
			(for example, a fine or term of imprisonment). Originally, a Bill of 
			Attainder sentenced an individual to death, though this detail is no 
			longer required to have an enactment be ruled a Bill of Attainder.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="CONCUR">Concurrence</a></strong><br>
			concur <em>v.</em> 1. To have the same opinion; agree [&lt;Lat. <em>concurrere.</em> 
			to meet] <strong>concurrence <em>n.</em></strong></p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="CREDIT">Bill of Credit</a></strong><br>
			A bill of credit is some sort of paper medium by which value is exchanged 
			between the government and individuals. Money is a bill of credit, but 
			a bill of credit need not be money. An interest-bearing certificate 
			that was issued by Missouri, and usable in the payment of taxes, was 
			thus ruled to be an unconstitutional bill of credit.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="BLOOD">Corruption of Blood</a></strong><br>
			Corruption of Blood was part of ancient English penalty for treason. 
			It was usually part of a Bill of Attainder, which normally sentenced 
			the accused to death. The corruption of blood would forbid the accused&#39;s 
			family from inhereting his property. Such bills and punishments were 
			often inflicted upon Tories by colonial governments immediately following 
			independence.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="DEPRIVE">Deprive</a></strong><br>
			deprive <em>v.</em> 1. To take something away from; divest. 2. To keep 
			from the possession of something. [&lt;Med. Lat. <em>deprivare</em>]</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="DOMTRAN">Domestic Tranquility</a></strong><br>
			One of the concerns of the Framers was that the government prior to 
			that under the Constitution was unable, by force or persuasion, to quell 
			rebellion or quarrels amongst the states. The government watched in 
			horror as Shay&#39;s Rebellion transpired just before the Convention, and 
			some states had very nearly gone to war with each other over territory 
			(such as between Pennsylvania and Connecticut over Wilkes-Barre). One 
			of the main goals of the Convention, then, was to ensure the federal 
			government had powers to squash rebellion and to smooth tensions between 
			states.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="DOUBLEJ">Double Jeopardy</a></strong><br>
			Double jeopardy is a term used in law. Double jeopardy is forbidden 
			by the Constitution. Double jeopardy is what would happen is someone 
			were to be charged with a crime and be found innocent, and then be charged 
			with that crime a second time. For example, if you are charged with 
			stealing a car, and a jury finds you innocent, you cannot be charged 
			with stealing the car again.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="EMOLUMENT">Emolument</a></strong><br>
			emolument <em>n</em> [ME, fr. L <em>emolumentum</em>, lit., miller&#39;s 
			fee, fr <em>emolere</em> to grind up] : the product (as salary or fees) 
			of an employment</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="ENUMERATE">Enumerate</a></strong><br>
			enumerate <em>vb</em> 1 : to determine the number of : count 2 : list</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="EXCISE">Excise</a></strong><br>
			excise <em>n</em> a tax on the manufacture, sale, or consumption of 
			goods within a country</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="EXPOST">Ex post facto</a></strong><br>
			ex post facto <em>adj.</em> Formulated, enacted, or operating retroactively. 
			[Med Lat., from what is done afterwards]</p>
			<p>In U.S. Constitutional Law, the definition of what is ex post facto 
			is more limited. The first definition of what exactly constitutes an 
			ex post facto law is found in <i>Calder v Bull</i> (3 US 386 [1798]), 
			in the opinion of Justice Chase:</p>
			<p><q><em>1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing 
			of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes 
			such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater 
			than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, 
			and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, 
			when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, 
			and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at 
			the time of the commission of the offense, in order to convict the offender.</em></q></p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="HABCOR">Habeas Corpus</a></strong><br>
			habeas corpus <em>n. Law</em> A writ issued to bring a party before 
			a court to prevent unlawful restraint. [&lt;Med. Lat., you should have 
			the body]</p>
			<p>The basic premise behind habeas corpus is that you cannot be held 
			against your will without just cause. To put it another way, you cannot 
			be jailed if there are no charges against you. If you are being held, 
			and you demand it, the courts must issue a writ of habeas corpus, which 
			forces those holding you to answer as to why. If there is no good or 
			compelling reason, the court must set you free. It is important to note 
			that of all the civil liberties we take for granted today as a part 
			of the Bill of Rights, the importance of habeas corpus is illustrated 
			by the fact that it was the sole liberty thought important enough to 
			be included in the original text of the Constitution.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="IMPARTIAL">Impartial</a></strong><br>
			impartial <em>adj.</em> Not partial or biased; unprejudiced.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="IMPEACH">Impeachment</a></strong><br>
			Impeachment, in the U.S. and Great Britain, proceeding by a legislature 
			for the removal from office of a public official charged with misconduct 
			in office. Impeachment comprises both the act of formulating the accusation 
			and the resulting trial of the charges; it is frequently but erroneously 
			taken to mean only the removal from office of an accused public official. 
			An impeachment trial may result in either an acquittal or in a verdict 
			of guilty. In the latter case the impeached official is removed from 
			office; if the charges warrant such action, the official is also remanded 
			to the proper authorities for trial before a court.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="IMPOST">Impost</a></strong><br>
			impost <em>n</em> tax, duty</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="INFRINGE">Infringe</a></strong><br>
			infringe <em>vb</em> [Latin <em>infringere</em>] 1: violate, transgress 
			2: encroach, trespass</p>
			<p>In the context of the Constitution, phrases like &quot;shall not be infringed,&quot; 
			&quot;shall make no law,&quot; and &quot;shall not be violated&quot; sound pretty unbendable, 
			but the Supreme Court has ruled that <em>some</em> laws can, in fact, 
			encroach on these phrases. For example, though there is freedom of speech, 
			you cannot slander someone; though you can own a pistol, you cannot 
			own a nuclear weapon.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="JURIS">Jurisdiction</a></strong><br>
			jurisdiction <em>n</em> the power, right, or authority to interpret 
			and apply the law : the limits or territory within which authority may 
			be exercised</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="MARQUE">Letter of Marque</a></strong><br>
			Archaic. A letter of marque was issued by a nation to a privateer or 
			mercenary to act on the behalf of that nation for the purpose of retaliating 
			against another nation for some wrong, such as a border incursion or 
			seizure.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="NOBILITY">Nobility, Title of</a></strong><br>
			Nobility is technically a station in society that is had simply by being 
			born into the right family. The class of persons, well-characterized 
			by the aristocracy of Great Britain, were considered to be higher in 
			status and power because of the family name. A title of nobility indicated 
			that status, where a person was a king, queen, prince, princess, count, 
			countess, duke, duchess, baron, or baroness; these titles were granted 
			by the monarch at some point in the family history and passed from parent 
			to child. The Framers wished to ensure that no such system of heredity 
			developed in the United States and specifically prohibited any state 
			or the federal government from granting any title of nobility.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="ORDAIN">Ordain</a></strong><br>
			ordain <em>v.</em> 2. To order by or as if by decree. [&lt;Lat. <em>ordinaire,</em> 
			to organize]</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="POLLTAX">Poll Tax</a></strong><br>
			A poll tax has had two historical meanings. The older is that of a fee 
			that had to be paid to satisfy taxpayer requirements in voting laws. 
			In some places, only people who could demonstrate a financial tie to 
			a community were permitted to vote in that community. For those who 
			did not otherwise own property or pay taxes, this sort of poll tax was 
			sufficient to allow voting. More recently, however, a poll tax is a 
			tax that must be paid by anyone wishing to cast a vote. Poll taxes of 
			this sort were generally low, perhaps a dollar or two, but high enough 
			to make voting uneconomical for poor people. The 24th Amendment bars 
			both of these types of poll tax.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="POSTROAD">Post road</a></strong><br>
			post road <em>n</em> a road over which mail is carried</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="POSTERITY">Posterity</a></strong><br>
			posterity <em>n.</em> 1. Future generations. 2. All of a person&#39;s descendants. 
			[&lt;Lat. <em>posteritas.</em>]</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="PROTEM">Pro tempore</a></strong><br>
			pro tempore <em>adv.</em> For the time being; temporarily. Also: Pro 
			tem.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="QUARTER">Quarter</a></strong><br>
			quarter <em>vb.</em> to provide with shelter</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="QUORUM">Quorum</a></strong><br>
			quorum <em>n.</em> the number of members required to be present for 
			business to be legally conducted</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="REDRESS">Redress</a></strong><br>
			redress <em>v.</em> 1. To set right, remedy or rectify. 2. To make amends 
			for. <em>n.</em> 1. Satisfaction for wrong done; reparation. 2. Correction. 
			[&lt;OFr. <em>redresser.</em>]</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="REPRISAL">Reprisal</a></strong><br>
			Archaic. An act taken by a nation, short of war, to gain redress for 
			an action taken against that nation. For example, seizing a ship in 
			retaliation for a seized ship.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="REPUBLIC">Republic</a></strong><br>
			republic <em>n</em> <strong>1</strong> : a government having a chief 
			of state who is not a monarch and is usually a president; also : a nation 
			or other political unit having such a government <strong>2</strong> 
			: a government in which supreme power is held by the citizens entitled 
			to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives governing 
			according to law; also : a nation or other political unit having such 
			a form of government</p>
			<p>In the context of the United States, both definitions apply.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="SUFF">Suffrage</a></strong><br>
			suffrage <em>n.</em> 1. A vote. 2. The right or privilege of voting; 
			franchise.</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="TREASON">Treason</a></strong><br>
			treason <em>n</em> the offense of attempting to overthrow the government 
			of one&#39;s country or of assisting its enemies in war</p>
			<hr>
			<p><strong><a name="WELFARE">Welfare</a></strong><br>
			welfare <em>n.</em> 1. health, happiness, or prosperity; well-being. 
			[&lt;ME <em>wel faren,</em> to fare well]</p>
			<p>Welfare in today&#39;s context also means organized efforts on the part 
			of public or private organizations to benefit the poor, or simply public 
			assistance. This is not the meaning of the word as used in the Constitution.</p>
