              <font class="storytext">
              <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York Yankees player was killed when 
              the small aircraft he was piloting crashed into a 52-story building 
              on Manhattan&#39;s posh Upper East Side on Wednesday, the famed baseball 
              team said.</p>
              <p>The four-seat plane belonged to pitcher Cory Lidle, 34, who died 
              along with a flying instructor.</p>
              <p>&quot;This is a terrible and shocking tragedy that has stunned the entire 
              Yankees organization,&quot; club owner George Steinbrenner said in a statement.</p>
              <p>&quot;I offer my deep condolences and prayers to his wife Melanie and 
              son Christopher on their enormous loss.&quot;</p>
              <p>The crash occurred in overcast weather.</p>
              <p>A New York police spokesman said the crash was being investigated 
              as an accident and that while police could not rule out suicide, there 
              was nothing to suggest that.</p>
              <p>Smoke and flames poured from the upper floors of the high-rise 
              building and more than 100 firefighters were sent to the scene, reviving 
              memories of the September 11 attacks.</p>
              <p>In a city still jittery after the attacks more than five years 
              ago, U.S. and New York officials were quick to say -- even before 
              Lidle was identified as the pilot -- they had no reason to believe 
              the crash was related to terrorism.</p>
              <p>Born in Hollywood, California, Lidle appeared last Saturday as 
              a relief pitcher in the Yankees&#39; final game of the season when they 
              lost an American League playoff series to the Tigers in Detroit. His 
              journeyman Major League career began with the New York Mets in 1997.</p>
              <p>He was traded to the Yankees this summer from the Philadelphia 
              Phillies. His nine-year career record was 82 wins and 72 losses.</p>
              <p>New York Presbyterian hospital said in a statement the facility 
              had treated 21 patients -- 15 firefighters, one police officer and 
              five civilians.</p>
              <p>The New York Times reported last month Lidle earned his pilot&#39;s 
              license in the past year and bought the four-seat Cirrus SR 20 plane, 
              with less than 400 hours of flight time, for $187,000.</p>
              <p>In 1979, Yankees all-star catcher Thurman Munson died at age 32 
              when a plane he was piloting crashed at Akron-Canton Regional Airport 
              in Ohio while he practiced takeoffs and landings.</p>
              <p>Lidle told the Times in an interview last month that Yankees fans 
              should not worry he would suffer the same fate, insisting his plane 
              was safe.</p>
              <p>&quot;The whole plane has a parachute on it,&quot; Lidle said. &quot;Ninety-nine 
              percent of pilots that go up never have engine failure, and the 1 
              percent that do usually land it. But if you&#39;re up in the air and something 
              goes wrong, you pull that parachute, and the whole plane goes down 
              slowly.&quot;</p>
              <p>&#39;TOTAL DISBELIEF&#39;</p>
              <p>Mets pitching coach Rick Peterson, who worked with Lidle with the 
              Oakland Athletics, said of his friend&#39;s death, &quot;You feel like your 
              soul has been totally bruised.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;The reaction is just total disbelief,&quot; he told reporters at Shea 
              Stadium, home of the Mets.</p>
              <p>Military fighter jets patrolled several U.S. cities as a precaution 
              after the crash, the North American Aerospace Defense Command said.</p>
              <p>On Wall Street, U.S. stocks extended losses but quickly recovered 
              once it became clear the crash was not an attack similar to the hijacked 
              plane attacks of September 11, 2001.</p>
              <p>The plane took off from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, just miles 
              (km) from Manhattan, and circled the Statue of Liberty before flying 
              north and eventually crashing, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told 
              reporters at a briefing.</p>
              <p>The aircraft crashed at East 72nd St. and York Avenue, near the 
              East River, a 1980s building housing mainly upscale residential apartments 
              but which also has a specialized hospital on the bottom 12 floors.</p>
              <p>Luis Gonzales, 23, was working in the building remodeling a nearby 
              apartment and saw the crash.</p>
              <p>&quot;I was looking out the window and I saw the plane coming so close 
              to us and it swerved to try and avoid the building but it hit the 
              building,&quot; he said. &quot;I am still shaking.&quot;</p>
              <p>It was not the first time a plane accidentally crashed into a Manhattan 
              high rise. In 1945, the pilot of a B-25 bomber became lost in fog 
              and disoriented, crashing into the Empire State Building and killing 
              14 people.</p>

                  news</font><font face="Arial" size="1"></p>
                  <p><font class="storytext">NEW YORK (AP) - Of all his New York 
                  Yankee teammates, perhaps the one hit hardest by the death of 
                  Cory Lidle is Jason Giambi. <br>
                  <br>
                  He knew Lidle and his wife for more than 18 years. They not only 
                  played together in the Bronx, but also for the Oakland A&#39;s, and 
                  even back in high school in California. Giambi says in a statement 
                  he was excited that they were reunited this past season, when 
                  Lidle was traded to the Yankees. He calls news of his death devastating.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Yankees captain Derek Jeter says beyond being a ballplayer, Lidle 
                  was &quot;more importantly&quot; a husband and father. Jeter says his thoughts 
                  are with Lidle&#39;s widow and six-year-old son. <br>
                  <br>
                  Yanks pitcher Mike Myers is among those recalling Lidle&#39;s love 
                  of flying. He says they were supposed to fly down to Atlantic 
                  City, New Jersey, last month, but those plans were canceled.
