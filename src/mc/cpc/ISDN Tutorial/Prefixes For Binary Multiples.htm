    <p><font face="Myriad Roman,Syntax,Gill,Gill Sans,Arial,Helvetica">It is suggested 
    that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix 
    should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the 
    corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as 
    &quot;bee.&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Myriad Roman,Syntax,Gill,Gill Sans,Arial,Helvetica">It is important 
    to recognize that the new prefixes for binary multiples are not part of the 
    International System of Units (SI), the modern metric system. However, for ease 
    of understanding and recall, they were derived from the SI prefixes for positive 
    powers of ten. As can be seen from the above table, the name of each new prefix 
    is derived from the name of the corresponding SI prefix by retaining the first 
    two letters of the name of the SI prefix and adding the letters &quot;bi,&quot; which 
    recalls the word &quot;binary.&quot; Similarly, the symbol of each new prefix is derived 
    from the symbol of the corresponding SI prefix by adding the letter &quot;i,&quot; which 
    again recalls the word &quot;binary.&quot; (For consistency with the other prefixes for 
    binary multiples, the symbol Ki is used for 2<sup>10</sup> rather than ki.)</font>

    <font face="Myriad Roman,Syntax,Gill,Gill Sans,Arial,Helvetica">These prefixes 
    for binary multiples, which were developed by IEC Technical Committee (TC) 25, 
    Quantities and units, and their letter symbols, with the strong support of the 
    International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and the Institute of 
    Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), were first adopted by the IEC as
    <i>Amendment 2 to IEC International Standard IEC 60027-2: Letter symbols to 
    be used in electrical technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics</i>. 
    The full content of <i>Amendment 2,</i> which has a publication date of 1999-01, 
    is reflected in the tables above and the suggestion regarding pronunciation. 
    Subsequently the contents of this Amendment were incorportated in the second 
    edition of IEC 60027-2, which has a publication date of 2000-11 (the first edition 
    was published in 1972). The complete citation for this revised standard is IEC 
    60027-2, Second edition, 2000-11, <i>Letter symbols to be used in electrical 
    technology - Part 2: Telecommunications and electronics.</i></font> </p>

    Historical context<sup>*</sup></font> <br>
    <font face="Myriad Roman,Syntax,Gill,Gill Sans,Arial,Helvetica">Once upon a 
    time, computer professionals noticed that 2<sup>10</sup> was very nearly equal 
    to 1000 and started using the SI prefix &quot;kilo&quot; to mean 1024. That worked well 
    enough for a decade or two because everybody who talked kilobytes knew that 
    the term implied 1024 bytes. But, almost overnight a much more numerous &quot;everybody&quot; 
    bought computers, and the trade computer professionals needed to talk to physicists 
    and engineers and even to ordinary people, most of whom know that a kilometer 
    is 1000 meters and a kilogram is 1000 grams.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Myriad Roman,Syntax,Gill,Gill Sans,Arial,Helvetica">Then data 
    storage for gigabytes, and even terabytes, became practical, and the storage 
    devices were not constructed on binary trees, which meant that, for many practical 
    purposes, binary arithmetic was less convenient than decimal arithmetic. The 
    result is that today &quot;everybody&quot; does not &quot;know&quot; what a megabyte is. When discussing 
    computer memory, most manufacturers use megabyte to mean <nobr>2<sup>20</sup> 
    = 1 048 576</nobr> bytes, but the manufacturers of computer storage devices 
    usually use the term to mean <nobr>1 000 000</nobr> bytes. Some designers of 
    local area networks have used megabit per second to mean <nobr>1 048 576 bit/s,</nobr> 
    but all telecommunications engineers use it to mean 10<sup>6</sup> bit/s. And 
    if two definitions of the megabyte are not enough, a third megabyte of <nobr>
    1 024 000 bytes</nobr> is the megabyte used to format the familiar 90 mm (3 
    1/2 inch), &quot;1.44 MB&quot; diskette. The confusion is real, as is the potential for 
    incompatibility in standards and in implemented systems.</font> </p>
    <p><font face="Myriad Roman,Syntax,Gill,Gill Sans,Arial,Helvetica">Faced with 
    this reality, the IEEE Standards Board decided that IEEE standards will use 
    the conventional, internationally adopted, definitions of the SI prefixes. Mega 
    will mean <nobr>1 000 000,</nobr> except that the base-two definition may be 
    used (if such usage is explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis) until 
    such time that prefixes for binary multiples are adopted by an appropriate standards 
    body. </font>&nbsp;<br>
