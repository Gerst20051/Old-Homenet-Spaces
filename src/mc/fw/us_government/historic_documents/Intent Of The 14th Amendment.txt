   Intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to Protect All
                         Rights

The main clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment are:

     Section. 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United
     States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of
     the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No
     State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
     privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor
     shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
     property, without due process of law; nor deny to any
     person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
     laws.
     ...

     Section. 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by
     appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

This seemingly simple language has given rise to endless controversy over 
its interpretation. Beginning with the Slaughterhouse Cases, the Supreme 
Court has decided cases involving the Fourteenth by selectively invoking 
only the most minimal and restrictive rights needed to decide each case, and 
never declaring in dictum that the Fourteenth protects all rights recognized 
by the Constitution. This has led to the doctrine of selective incorporation 
of the Bill of rights, most of which have eventually been included in the 
protection, but a few of which have not.

Two of the Bill of Rights that have not been "incorporated" are the Second 
Amendment and the Fifth. The Supreme Court has avoided taking any cases that 
would require it to rule on the right to keep and bear arms or assemble as 
an independent militia. It has, however, ruled that several provisions of 
the Fifth Amendment do not apply to the states. The first major case was 
Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884), in which it held that a state 
was not required to indict by grand jury. The issues were set forth well by 
Justice Harlan in Hurtado, whose dissenting opinion is correct. 
Unfortunately, the majority did not agree with him. The state was 
California, and although grand juries in California still have the power of 
indictment, most crimes are prosecuted upon an information, which is only a 
finding by a lower magistrate. On the basis of this decision, a few states 
have even eliminated the grand jury system altogether.

Subsequent important cases were Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), 
which held a state is not required to protect the right against self-
incrimination; Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937), which held a state 
is not required to protect the right against double jeopardy; and Adamson v. 
California, 332 U.S. 46 (1947), which held that the decision of an accused 
not to testify may be used against him in a state criminal trial. The 
dissent of Justice Black in Adamson is especially interesting because he set 
forth in an Appendix much of the material presented below.

The framers of the 14th could have expressed themselves more clearly. The 
record below indicates what happened. They became a inner circle of debaters 
who developed their own understanding of the formulations they drafted 
without testing the language on outsiders to see how it might be 
misunderstood. When Bingham and the others spoke to the public, they 
expressed their intent for the amendments, but seldom actually presented the 
draft language for public comment. It was available, of course, but one had 
to seek it out, and in the heat of the times, most people weren't focused on 
how the language might be misconstrued by outsiders or later generations.

This statements of the Fourteenth were adopted for a reason. They were not 
without force and effect. They were intended by the framers of the 
Fourteenth to extend the jurisdiction and protection of federal courts to 
all rights recognized by the Constitution and Bill of Rights against actions 
by state government.

First, "any law" includes the state constitution, which is its supreme law, 
subject to the U.S. Constitution.

Second, for the framers of the 14th Amendment the term of art, "immunities", 
meant all those rights recognized and protected by the Constitution and Bill 
of Rights, including those of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. The framers of 
the Fourteenth used the word "immunities" because the rights recognized and 
protected by the Constitution and Bill of Rights are rights against action 
by government, which are "immunities", as distinct from contractual or tort 
rights.

If there is any doubt as to what the framers of the Fourteenth meant by their 
words, here are some more of their words, taken from debates in Congress and 
the press during the drafting and ratification debates on the amendment. 
What follows has been heavily based on Halbrook, Stephen P., Freedmen, the 
Fourteenth Amendment, and the Right to Bear Arms, 1866-1876, Westport, CT: 
Praeger, 1998.



On Jan 12., 1866, Rep. John Bingham of Ohio began the drafting of the 
Fourteenth by a proposed amendment to the Joint Senate-House Committee of 
15: 

     The Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary
     and proper to secure to all persons in every state within this
     Union equal protection in their rights of life, liberty and
     property.[1]

Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania proposed a similar guarantee:

     All laws, state or national, shall operate impartially and
     equally on all persons without regard to race or color.[2]

On Jan. 19 Connecticut Representative Henry Deming introduced a 
constitutional amendment similar to Bingham's that declared:

     That Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary
     and proper to secure to all persons in every State equal
     protection in their rights of life, liberty, and property.[3]

On January 20 the Joint Committee's subcommittee considering drafts of 
constitutional amendments reported to the full Joint Committee an expanded 
form of the Bingham proposal that read as follows:

     Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and
     proper to secure to all citizens of the United States, in every
     State, the same political rights and privileges; and to all
     persons in every State equal protection in the enjoyment of
     life, liberty and property."[4]

A wholly separate proposed amendment would have stated, in addition to the 
above:

     All provisions in the Constitution or laws of any State,
     whereby any distinction is made in political or civil rights or
     privileges, on account of race, creed or color, shall be
     inoperative and void."[5]

The word "creed" was deleted by the full committee, perhaps to exclude 
atheists or Confederate sympathizers.[6] Stevens proposed and subsequently 
withdrew a constitutional amendment that defined United States citizens as 
"all persons born in the United States, or naturalized, excepting 
Indians."[7]

On January 27 the Joint Committee considered a draft of the constitutional 
amendment reported by the subcommittee of Bingham, Boutwell, and Rogers. It 
now read:

     Congress shall have power to make laws which shall be
     necessary and proper to secure all persons in every state
     full protection in the enjoyment of life, liberty and property;
     and to all citizens of the United States in every State the
     same immunities and also equal political rights and
     privileges.[8]

Johnson lost his motion to strike the privileges and immunities clause.[9] 
Further consideration was postponed until the next meeting.[10]

On February 1, 1866, Senator Benjamin G. Brown of Missouri introduced, and 
the Senate adopted, a resolution that the Joint Committee consider an 
amendment to the Constitution

     so as to declare with greater certainty the power of
     Congress to enforce and determine by appropriate
     legislation all the guarantees contained in that
     instrument[11] (emphasis added).

This resolution thus anticipated the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment to 
incorporate the Bill of Rights.

In debate on S. 61, the Civil Rights Bill, some Western senators wished to 
exclude Indians and Chinese from citizenship. Williams of Oregon argued that 
if Indians were citizens, then state laws that prohibited whites from 
selling arms and ammunition to Indians would be void.[12] At a time when the 
suppression of Indians and the seizure of their lands was proceeding in 
earnest, it was considered unacceptable to recognize a right of Indians to 
keep and bear arms. Thus, the Senate voted to define all persons born in the 
United States, without distinction of color, as citizens, "excluding Indians 
not taxed."[13] 

In the House, debate on the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, S. 60, began with a 
procedural ruling that delayed the offering of amendments. Nathaniel P. 
Banks, a former governor of Massachusetts and Union general, stated: "I 
shall move, if I am permitted to do so, to amend the seventh section of this 
bill by inserting after the word 'including' the words 'the constitutional 
right to bear arms'; so that it will read, 'including the constitutional 
right to bear arms, the right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, 
&c.'"[14] The section would thus have recognized "the civil rights belonging 
to white persons, including the constitutional right to bear arms."

The House then returned to debate on the bill. Supporting its passage, 
Representative Ignatius Donnelly noted that "there is an amendment offered 
by the distinguished gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Bingham] which provides in 
effect that Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation 
all the guarantees of the Constitution."[15] Once again, Bingham's draft of 
the Fourteenth Amendment was seen as protecting Bill of Rights guarantees.

On February 2, Davis introduced a substitute for S. 61, the Civil Rights 
Bill. It declared that any person "who shall subject or cause to be 
subjected a citizen of the United States to the deprivation of any privilege 
or immunity in any State to which such citizen is entitled under the 
Constitution and laws of the United States" shall have an action for 
damages, and that such conduct would be a misdemeanor[16] (emphasis added). 
Davis' substitute suggests that even opponents of the Civil Rights Bill were 
willing to concede that the explicit guarantees of the Bill of Rights should 
be protected. Davis grounded his compromise bill in the privileges and 
immunities clause of article IV.[17]

On February 3 Representative L. H. Rousseau of Kentucky quoted § 7 of S. 60, 
including the terms "all laws and proceedings for the security of person and 
estate," and then referred in part to "the security to person and property 
from unreasonable search."[18] This suggested that the Fourth Amendment and 
other Bill of Rights provisions were encompassed in the "laws and 
proceedings for the security of person and estate," and indeed the 
Freedmen's Bureau Bill would later pass stating that "the constitutional 
right to bear arms" was encompassed within this language.[19]

The Joint Committee met in secret that day to consider the proposed 
constitutional amendment. Bingham offered the following substitute for the 
subcommittee draft: "The Congress shall have power to make all laws which 
shall be necessary and proper to secure to the citizens of each state all 
privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states (Art. 4, Sec. 
2); and to all persons in the several States equal protection in the rights 
of life, liberty and property (5th Amendment)."[20] Bingham's substitute was 
agreed to on a nonpartisan vote of 7 to 6, with Democrat Rogers joining with 
Howard in voting in the affirmative.[21] Ironically, Rogers then cast the 
deciding vote against the amendment as such.[22]

On February 13, 1866, it was reported in both houses of Congress that the 
Joint Committee had recommended adoption of a constitutional amendment to 
read as follows:

     The Congress shall have power to make all laws which
     shall be necessary and proper to secure to the citizens of
     each State all privileges and immunities of citizens in the
     several States; and to all persons in the several States equal
     protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property.[23]

This appears to be the first reported draft of what would become § 1 of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. Note that it substituted the legal term of art 
"immunities" for "rights", in a context that makes it clear the meaning is 
equivalent, but chosen to emphasize that it is rights against the actions of 
government that is intended, and that it included all such rights, not only 
those mentioned in Amendments 1-8, but those in the original Constitution, 
the unenumerated rights of the Ninth Amendment, and the right recognized in 
the Tenth Amendment not to have government exercise undelegated powers.

In the Senate on February 19, Wilson introduced S.R. 32, a joint resolution 
to disband the militia forces in most Southern states.[24] Wilson quoted 
detailed accounts of militia abuses, including the report of General Howard 
that had been submitted to the Joint Committee that Southern militias "were 
engaged in disarming the negroes. This created great discontent among the 
latter."[25]

In opposition to referring the joint resolution to committee, Senator 
Saulsbury argued that the power of Congress under Article I, § 8 to 
organize, arm, and discipline the militia

     Does not give power to Congress to disarm the militia of a
     State, or to destroy the militia of a State, because in
     another provision of the Constitution, the second
     amendment, we have these words:

          "A well-regulated militia being necessary to
          the security of a free State, the right of the
          people to keep and bear arms shall not be
          infringed."

     The proposition here ... is an application to Congress to do
     that which Congress has no right to do under the second
     amendment of the Constitution.[26] 

Although just three weeks earlier Saulsbury had opposed the Civil Rights 
Bill because it would prohibit states from disarming free negroes,[27] he 
now invoked the Second Amendment to protect the right of "the whole white 
population" not only to be armed but also to organize and operate as 
militia. This is a clear indication that the rights to be protected included 
the right to keep and bear arms.

The first draft of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment was debated in the 
House for three days, beginning on February 27, 1866. Bingham, its author, 
argued on its behalf that previously "this immortal bill of rights embodied 
in the Constitution, rested for its execution and enforcement hitherto upon 
the fidelity of the States."[28]

Representative Robert Hale of New York saw no need for the amendment, 
because he interpreted the existing Bill of Rights to bind not just Congress 
but also the States: "Now, what are these amendments to the Constitution, 
numbered from one to ten, one of which is the fifth article in question? . . 
. They constitute the bill of rights, a bill of rights for the protection of 
the citizen, and defining and limiting the power of Federal and State 
legislation."[29]

Bingham responded that the proposed amendment would "arm the Congress ... 
with the power to enforce this bill of rights as it stands in the 
Constitution today."[30] Representative Frederick E. Woodbridge of Vermont 
characterized the sweep of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment as empowering 
Congress to protect "the natural rights which necessarily pertain to 
citizenship."[31]

In debate on February 28 on the representation of the Southern States in 
Congress, Senator James Nye of Nevada opined that the Bill of Rights already 
applied to the States, and that Congress has power to enforce it against the 
States. He stated:

     In the enumeration of natural and personal rights to be
     protected, the framers of the Constitution apparently
     specified everything they could think of -- "life," "liberty,"
     "property," "freedom of speech," "freedom of the press,"
     "freedom in the exercise of religion," "security of person,"
     &c.; and then, lest something essential in the specifications
     should have been overlooked, it was provided in the ninth
     amendment that "the enumeration in the Constitution of
     certain rights should not be construed to deny or disparage
     other rights not enumerated." ... All these rights are
     established by the fundamental law.

     Will it be contended, sir, at this day, that any State has the
     power to subvert or impair the natural and personal rights
     of the citizen?

Referring to blacks, Senator Nye continued: "As citizens of the United 
States they have equal right to protection, and to keep and bear arms for 
self-defense."[32]

Similarly, Senator Stewart repeated that the federal Constitution is "the 
vital, sovereign, and controlling part of the fundamental law of every 
State," and although the states may repeat parts of it in their own bills of 
rights, "no State can adopt anything in a State constitution in 
conflict."[33]

A significant debate in the House on S. 61, the civil rights bill, took 
place on March 1. Representative Wilson, chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, explained the background to the bill's phraseology "civil rights 
and immunities" and "full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for 
the security of person and property."[34] Quoting Kent's Commentaries, 
Wilson explained: "I understand civil rights to be simply the absolute 
rights of individuals, such as -- 'The right of personal security, the right 
of personal liberty, and the right to acquire and enjoy property.'"[35] 
Wilson added that "we are reducing to statute from the spirit of the 
Constitution,"[36] a clear reference to the Bill of Rights. Referring to 
"the great fundamental civil rights," Wilson pointed out:

     [Sir William] Blackstone classifies them under three articles,
     as follows: 

     1. The right of personal security; which, he says, "Consists
     in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life,
     his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation."

     2. The right of personal liberty; and this, he says, "Consists
     in the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or
     moving one's person to whatever place one's own
     inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint,
     unless by due course of law."

     3. The right of personal property; which he defines to be,
     "The free use, enjoyment, and disposal of all his
     acquisitions, without any control or diminution, save only by
     the law of the land."[37]

To protect "the principal absolute rights which appertain to every 
Englishman," Blackstone explained that there are "auxiliary" rights to 
"maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights, of personal 
security, personal liberty, and private property."[38] Blackstone included 
among these rights "that of having arms for their defence suitable to their 
condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law," that made possible 
"the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions 
of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of 
oppression."[39] Together with justice in the courts and the right of 
petition, "the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and 
defense" were available to preserve the rights to life, liberty, and 
property.[40]

The Freedmen's Bureau Bill likewise declared that the rights of personal 
security and personal liberty included what Blackstone referred to as "the 
right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defense."[41] 
Senator Wilson had the Second Amendment partly in mind when he stated that 
every right enumerated in the federal Constitution is "embodied in one of 
the rights I have mentioned, or results as an incident necessary to complete 
defense and enjoyment of the specific right."[42]

Opponents agreed. Representative Rogers declared that S. 61, the Civil 
Rights Bill, "is nothing but a relic of the Freedmen's Bureau bill,"[43] 
which declared explicitly that the rights of personal security and personal 
liberty included "the constitutional right of bearing arms." Even Rogers 
held that "the rights of nature" included "the right of self-defense, the 
right to protect our lives from invasion by others."[44]

Another Democrat, Representative Anthony Thornton of Illinois, argued in a 
speech on Reconstruction on March 3 that the South had no monopoly on 
violation of rights. In the North during the Civil War "freedom of speech 
was denied; the freedom of the press was abridged; the right to bear arms 
was infringed," yet these "inherent" rights were once again respected under 
the Constitution.[45]

On March 5 the Senate debated the basis of representation, which became § 2 
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Senator Samuel Pomeroy of Kansas, a supporter 
of the proposed amendment, stated:

     And what are the safeguards of liberty under our form of
     Government? There are at least, under our Constitution,
     three which are indispensable --

     1. Every man should have a homestead, that is, the right to
     acquire and hold one, and the right to be safe and
     protected in that citadel of his love.

     2. He should have the right to bear arms for the defense of
     himself and family and his homestead. And if the cabin door
     of the freedman is broken open and the intruder enters for
     purposes as vile as were known to slavery, then should a
     well-loaded musket be in the hand of the occupant to send
     the polluted wretch to another world, where his
     wretchedness will forever remain complete; and

     3. He should have the ballot.[46]

Pomeroy was uncertain whether the proposed Fourteenth Amendment would pass, 
but argued that the right to bear arms could be secured through the 
Enforcement Clause of the Thirteenth Amendment: "Sir, what is 'appropriate 
legislation' on the subject, namely, securing the freedom of all men? It can 
be nothing less than throwing about all men the essential safeguards of the 
Constitution. The 'right to bear arms' is not plainer taught or more 
efficient than the right to carry ballots. And if appropriate legislation 
will secure the one so can it also the other. And if both are necessary, and 
provided for in the Constitution as now amended, why then let us close the 
question by congressional legislation."[47]

On March 7 Eliot reintroduced the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, which was referred 
to the Select Committee on Freedmen.[48] This bill had a more refined 
formulation of the rights of personal security and personal liberty than the 
Civil Rights Bill as well as explicit recognition of "the constitutional 
right to bear arms."[49] The debates on the Civil Rights Bill, which quoted 
Blackstone in detail, apparently contributed to the more advanced 
draftsmanship in the Freedmen's Bureau Bill.

The Civil Rights Bill was debated on March 8 and 9. Representative John 
Broomall of Pennsylvania identified "the rights and immunities of citizens" 
as including the writ of habeas corpus and the right of petition.[50] 
Representative Henry Raymond of New York, the editor of the New York Times 
and a member of the Joint Committee, proposed an amendment to the bill 
declaring that all persons born in the United States are "citizens of the 
United States, and entitled to all rights and privileges as such."[51] This 
formulation is similar to what would become the Citizenship Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. Raymond explained:

     "Make the colored man a citizen of the United States and
     he has every right which you or I have as citizens of the
     United States under the laws and constitution of the United
     States. ... He has defined status; he has a country and a
     home; a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a
     right to bear arms"[52] (emphasis added).

Quoting Barron v. Baltimore (1833),[53] Representative Michael Kerr of 
Indiana argued that the Bill of Rights limited only Congress.[54] Martin 
Thayer of Pennsylvania responded: "Of what value are those guarantees if you 
deny all power on the part of the Congress of the United States to execute 
and enforce them?"[55] Thayer's argument exhibited the intent of what would 
become the Fourteenth Amendment.

House members then discussed the meaning in the Civil Rights Bill of "all 
laws and proceedings for the security of person and property." 
Representative Wilson referred to "the fundamental rights of the citizen 
commonly called civil rights" and the rights, such as the right to testify 
in court, "necessary to protect his personal liberty, his personal security, 
his right to property."[56] As the language of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill 
attests, the right to keep and bear arms was also necessary to guarantee 
personal liberty and personal security.

The next day Bingham explained that the Civil Rights Bill would "enforce in 
its letter and its spirit the bill of rights as embodied in that 
Constitution."[57] Citing Aristotle, Bingham argued that, by virtue of being 
a citizen, one is guaranteed every right in the Constitution.[58] In The 
Politics and other writings familiar to nineteenth-century Americans, 
Aristotle postulated that true citizenship included the right to possess 
arms, and that those who are deprived of arms are oppressed by armed 
tyrants.[59]

Bingham quoted § 1 of the Civil Rights Bill, including the terms "full and 
equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and 
property,"[60] and reiterated his support for "amending the Constitution of 
the United States, expressly prohibiting the States from any such abuse of 
power in the future."[61] He explained that "the seventh and eighth sections 
of the Freedmen's Bureau bill enumerate the same rights and all the rights 
and privileges that are enumerated in the first section of this [the Civil 
Rights] bill."[62] Bingham then quoted the seventh section of the Freedmen's 
Bureau Bill, which provided that all persons shall "have full and equal 
benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and estate, 
including the constitutional right of bearing arms."[63]

Bingham wished to "arm Congress with the power to ... punish all violations 
by State Officers of the bill of rights."[64] In drafting the first section 
of the Fourteenth Amendment, Bingham clearly sought to protect the same 
rights.

In House debate on March 24, Representative Leonard Myers of Pennsylvania 
referred to Alabama, "whose aristocratic and anti-republican laws, almost 
reenacting slavery, . . . impose an imprisonment of three months and a fine 
of $100.00 upon any one owning fire-arms."[65] To nullify such laws, Myers 
recommended the following imperatives:

     1. That no law of any State lately in insurrection shall
     impose by indirection a servitude which the Constitution
     now forbids....

     2. That each State shall provide for equality before the law,
     equal protection to life, liberty, and property, equal right to
     sue and be sued, to inherit, make contracts, and give
     testimony.[66]

Representative Roswell Hart of New York asserted that the United States had 
a duty to secure to the people of the Southern States a republican form of 
government, adding: "The Constitution clearly describes that to be a 
republican form of government for which it was expressly framed. A 
government . . . where 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall 
not be infringed.'"[67] Hart also mentioned rights under the First, Fourth, 
and Fifth Amendments.[68]

The Civil Rights Bill passed both houses,[69] but on March 27 President 
Johnson surprised everyone by vetoing it.[70] In the override debate in the 
Senate on April 4, Trumbull argued that every citizen has "inherent, 
fundamental rights which belong to free citizens or free men in all 
countries, such as the rights enumerated in this bill."[71] Trumbull quoted 
from Kent's Commentaries as follows: "The absolute rights of individuals may 
be resolved into the right of personal security, the right of personal 
liberty, and the right to acquire and enjoy property. These rights have been 
justly considered, and frequently declared, by the people of this country to 
be natural, inherent, and inalienable."[72]

These were the same rights generally recited in the Civil Rights Bill and 
explicitly expounded both by Blackstone and the Freedmen's Bureau Bill as 
including the right to bear arms. Trumbull's further quotation from Kent 
specifically states that the existence of these rights means that one may 
protect them: "The privileges and immunities conceded by the Constitution of 
the United States to citizens of the several States were to be confined to 
those which were, in their nature, fundamental, and belonged of right to the 
citizens of all free Governments. Such are the rights of protection of life 
and liberty, and to acquire and enjoy property."[73]

On April 6, 1866, the Senate voted to override Johnson's veto of the Civil 
Rights Bill.[74] An editorial in the New York Evening Post on the override 
vote referred to "the mischiefs for which the Civil Rights bill seeks to 
provide a remedy . . . that there will be no obstruction to the acquirement 
of real estate by colored men, no attempts to prevent their holding public 
assemblies, freely discussing the question of their own disabilities, 
keeping fire-arms."[75]

While the Senate was voting to override Johnson's veto, in the Joint 
Committee Senator Howard examined Brevet Lieutenant Colonel W.H.H. Beadle, 
superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau in North Carolina. Beadle testified 
about police brutality in Wilmington. In one instance, two policemen 
repeatedly struck a petite black woman with baseball bats. The police 
claimed self-defense.[76] In another incident, a black man was beaten by 
police based on a bogus weapons charge, and the policeman's word was enough 
to exonerate him.[77] Beadle also testified: "Some of the local police have 
been guilty of great abuses by pretending to have authority to disarm the 
colored people. They go in squads and search houses and seize arms. . . . 
Houses of colored men have been broken open, beds torn apart and thrown 
about the floor, and even trunks opened and money taken. A great variety of 
such offenses have been committed by the local police."[78]

Representative Lawrence made the same arguments in the House override debate 
on April 7 as Trumbull had made in the Senate. Quoting the same passage from 
Kent on the rights of personal security and personal liberty, Lawrence 
explained:

     It has never been deemed necessary to enact in any
     constitution or law that citizens should have the right to life
     or liberty or the right to acquire property. These rights are
     recognized by the Constitution as existing anterior to and
     independently of all laws and all constitutions.

     Without further authority I may assume, then, that there are
     certain absolute rights which pertain to every citizen, which
     are inherent, and of which a State cannot constitutionally
     deprive him. But not only are these rights inherent and
     indestructible, but the means whereby they may be
     possessed and enjoyed are equally so.[79]

This expresses the postulate that the rights to life and liberty, and the 
right to have arms to protect these rights, are inherent and cannot be 
infringed by a state.[80] Lawrence recalled the testimony before the Joint 
Committee that General Terry had refused demands by Virginia state officials 
"to take the arms of the blacks away from them."[81]

Representative Sidney Clarke of Kansas denounced Alabama for prohibiting 
blacks from owning firearms, and Mississippi for seizing arms of blacks.[82] 
He continued: "Sir, I find in the Constitution of the United States an 
article which declares that 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
shall not be infringed.' For myself, I shall insist that the reconstructed 
rebels of Mississippi respect the Constitution in their local laws."[83] 

On April 9, after both houses had mustered the requisite two-thirds vote to 
override Johnson's veto, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 became law.[84] As 
enacted, § 1 provided: "Citizens, of every race and color, without regard to 
any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, . . . shall have 
the same right, in every State and Territory in the United States, to make 
and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence, to inherit, 
purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to 
full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of 
person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens"[85] (emphasis added).

In a secret meeting of the Joint Committee on April 21, 1866, Stevens 
proposed a plan of reconstruction.[86] Section one of the proposal stated:

     "No discrimination shall be made by any state, nor by the
     United States, as to the civil rights of persons because of
     race, color, or previous condition of servitude."[87] That
     language had been submitted to Stevens by Robert Dale
     Owen, an ex-Representative and civil rights reformer,[88]
     who was a leading advocate of the right to keep and bear
     arms.[89]

Equality was necessary but insufficient for Bingham, who moved to add the 
following language: "nor shall any state deny to any person within its 
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, nor take private property for 
public use without just compensation."[90] The first phrase would become the 
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because Stevens' 
proposal had already prohibited discrimination, Bingham's "equal protection" 
was more than mere equality -- it was equal protection of rights, not equal 
deprivation of rights. Indeed, equal protection of "the laws" might well 
have included, in Bingham's mind, the Bill of Rights. The second phrase in 
Bingham's proposal, the "takings" clause of the Fifth Amendment, might have 
been intended to state explicitly only one of the Bill of Rights guarantees 
to be protected. This was similar to the recitation in the Freedmen's Bureau 
bill of the constitutional right to bear arms, mention of which was not 
intended to preclude protection of other guarantees.

Bingham's amendment failed, but the 5 to 7 vote was nonpartisan, with 
Democrats Johnson and Rogers voting with Bingham and Stevens in favor.[91] 
Stevens' original proposal was then adopted.[92] Bingham next introduced a 
proposal for a separate section, which ten members of the committee, 
including Johnson, approved: "No state shall make or enforce any law which 
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; 
nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without 
due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal 
protection of the laws."[93] The committee also approved the Enforcement 
Clause.[94]

A week later on April 28 Bingham moved, and the Joint Committee voted, to 
delete Stevens' draft prohibiting race discrimination as to civil rights and 
to insert Bingham's draft guaranteeing privileges and immunities, due 
process, and equal protection. This language became § 1 of the proposed 
constitutional amendment.[95] Stevens himself voted affirmatively, but 
Howard wanted to keep both.[96] The committee voted to require the Southern 
States to ratify the amendment as a condition of read-mission into the 
Union.[97] Finally, the committee decided to report the proposal of the 
constitutional amendment to Congress and to lift the veil of secrecy by 
notifying the newspapers.[98] The work of the Joint Committee was now over 
for all practical purposes.

Attention in Congress focused on the proposed Fourteenth Amendment and the 
second Freedmen's Bureau Bill. Three months had passed since the House 
considered a first draft of the constitutional amendment. On April 30 
Stevens, the leader of the House delegation to the Joint Committee, reported 
to the House a joint resolution proposing the constitutional amendment.[99] 
Stevens also introduced a bill from the Joint Committee that would require 
the Southern States to ratify the amendment and conform their constitutions 
and laws thereto as a condition of readmittance to the Union.[100]

On May 8 a report from the president written by Benjamin C. Truman on the 
condition of the Southern people was ordered to be printed by the Senate. 
Truman recalled the fear of a black insurrection in late 1865 and early 
1866, commenting:

     In consequence of this there were extensive seizures of
     arms and ammunition, which the negroes had foolishly
     collected, and strict precautions were taken to avoid any
     outbreak. Pistols, old muskets, and shotguns were taken
     away from them as such weapons would be wrested from
     the hands of lunatics. Since the holidays, however, there
     has been a great improvement in this matter; many of the
     whites appear to be ashamed of their former distrust, and
     the negroes are seldom molested now in carrying the
     fire-arms of which they make such a vain display. In one
     way or another they have procured great numbers of old
     army muskets and revolvers, particularly in Texas, and I
     have, in a few instances, been amused at the vigor and
     audacity with which they have employed them to protect
     themselves against the robbers and murderers that infest
     that State.[101]

This suggests that blacks exhibited their perceived entitlement to the right 
to keep and bear arms to the dismay of whites uncomfortable with allowing 
this liberty to ex-slaves.

What would become the Fourteenth Amendment was debated in the House on May 8 
through 10. Stevens remarked that its provisions "are all asserted, in some 
form or another, in our DECLARATION or organic law. But the Constitution 
limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation on the States. 
This Amendment supplies that defect, and allows Congress to correct the 
unjust legislation of the States."[102] Representative Thayer stated that 
the proposed amendment "simply brings into the Constitution what is found in 
the bill of rights of every State," and that "it is but incorporating in the 
Constitution of the United States the principle of the civil rights bill 
which has lately become a law."[103]

Bingham averred that the amendment would protect "the privileges and 
immunities of all the citizens of the Republic and the inborn rights of 
every person within its jurisdiction."[104] He added that it would furnish a 
remedy against state injustices, such as infliction of cruel and unusual 
punishment.[105] By stating that Eighth Amendment violations would be 
prohibited, Bingham implied that the Fourteenth Amendment would prohibit 
deprivations of any rights recognized in the Bill of Rights.[106]

The proposed Fourteenth Amendment passed the House on May 10.[107] The New 
York Evening Post remarked: "The first section merely reasserts the Civil 
Rights Act."[108] That act had been perceived by the Post as protecting 
"public assemblies" and "keeping firearms,"[109] that is, First and Second 
Amendment rights.

On May 22, Representative Eliot, on behalf of the Select Committee on 
Freedmen's Affairs, reported the second Freedmen's Bureau Bill,[110] which 
would become H.R. 613. As before the new bill recognized "the constitutional 
right to bear arms."[111] Bingham, author of § 1 of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, was a member of the select committee that had drafted this bill.

The need to protect the right to bear arms persisted. That same day (May 22) 
the president transmitted a report on Southern state laws concerning 
freedmen to the House. The report included black code provisions that 
prohibited the possession of firearms by freedmen. South Carolina made it 
unlawful for "persons of color to keep a firearm, sword, or other military 
weapon," without a license, except a farm owner could keep a shotgun or 
rifle "ordinarily used in hunting."[112] Florida made it unlawful for a 
black to enter a white railroad car and to possess "any bowie-knife, dirk, 
sword, fire-arms, or ammunition of any kind" without a license.[113] 
Although these state laws were well known, it is significant that they were 
received again in Congress on May 23, the first day that the Senate 
considered H.R. 127, which would become the Fourteenth Amendment.

Howard introduced the proposed amendment in the Senate on behalf of the 
Joint Committee, explaining "the views and motives which influenced that 
Committee."[114] After acknowledging the important role of the testimony 
before the Joint Committee, Howard referred to "the personal rights 
guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; 
such as freedom of speech and of the press;. .. the right to keep and bear 
arms"[115] (emphasis added). Howard averred: "The great object of the first 
section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States 
and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental 
guarantees"[116] (emphasis added).

In the ensuing debate, no one questioned Howard's premise that the Amendment 
made the first eight amendments applicable to the states.[117] Howard 
explained that Congress could enforce the Bill of Rights through the 
Enforcement Clause, "a direct affirmative delegation of power to Congress to 
carry out all the principles of all these guarantees."[118] Howard added: 
"It [the amendment] will, if adopted by the States, forever disable every 
one of them from passing laws trenching upon those fundamental rights and 
privileges which pertain to citizens of the United States, and to all 
persons who happen to be within their jurisdiction."[119]

Howard's explanation that the Fourteenth Amendment would protect "the 
personal rights guaranteed by the first eight amendments of the United 
States Constitution such as ... the right to keep and bear arms" appeared on 
the front page of the New York Times[120] and New York Herald[121] and were 
printed in the National Intelligencer[122] and Philadelphia Inquirer.[123] 
The New York Times found his speech "clear and cogent,"[124] while the 
Chicago Tribune found that it was "very forcible and well put, and commanded 
the close attention of the Senate."[125] "It will be observed," summarized 
the Baltimore Gazette, "that the first section is a general prohibition upon 
all of the States of abridging the privileges and immunities of the citizens 
of the United States, and secures for all the equal advantages and 
protection of the laws."[126] Other newspapers were impressed with the 
length or detail of Howard's explanation.[127]

While Howard was explaining in the Senate that the Fourteenth Amendment 
would protect the right to keep and bear arms from state infringement, the 
House was debating the second Freedmen's Bureau Bill,[128] § 8 of which 
protected "the constitutional right to bear arms."[129] Eliot observed that 
§ 8 "simply embodies the provisions of the civil rights bill, and gives to 
the President authority, through the Secretary of War, to extend military 
protection to secure those rights until the civil courts are in 
operation."[130] The constitutional basis of the bill was the Thirteenth 
Amendment.[131]

Eliot cited Freedmen's Bureau reports, such as that of General Fisk, who 
wrote of 25,000 discharged Union soldiers who were freedmen returning to 
their homes: "Their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities and 
confiscated for the benefit of the Commonwealth. The Union soldier is fined 
for bearing arms. Thus the right of the people to keep and bear arms as 
provided in the Constitution is infringed, and the Government for whose 
protection and preservation these soldiers have fought is denounced as 
meddlesome and despotic when through its agents it undertakes to protect its 
citizens in a constitutional right"[132] (emphasis added). Fisk added that 
the freedmen "are defenseless, for the civil-law officers disarm the colored 
man and hand him over to armed marauders."[133] 

The Fourteenth Amendment and the second Freedmen's Bureau Bill, H.R. 613, 
continued to be debated in the Senate and House respectively for several 
days. On May 29, the House passed H.R. 613 by a vote of 96 to 32, with 55 
abstaining.[134] The House immediately proceeded to consideration of the 
proposed constitutional amendment.[135]

Noting the House's passage of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, the New York 
Evening Post reprinted some of the black code provisions, which had been 
communicated to Congress by the president, including those punishing 
freedmen with flogging for keeping arms.[136] An editorial sarcastically 
stated:

     In South Carolina and Florida the freedmen are forbidden
     to wear or keep arms.

     We feel certain the President, who is, as he says, the
     peculiar friend and protector of the freedmen, was not
     aware of the code of South Carolina, or Florida, or
     Mississippi, when he vetoed that [Civil Rights] act. The
     necessity for such a measure, to secure impartial justice,
     will not be denied by any one who reads the extracts we
     have made.[137]

May 30 began with Senator Howard proposing to add the citizenship clause to 
§ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment as follows: "All persons born in the United 
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United 
States and of the States wherein they reside."[138] This language was 
designed to settle the issue raised in Dred Scott -- that is, who are 
citizens and thus have the bundle of rights appertaining to citizenship. 
After a raucous debate over making Indians, coolies, and gypsies citizens, 
the Senate passed Howard's language.[139]

Supporters of what became known as the Howard Amendment repeatedly asserted 
the broad character of the rights it protected. Senator Luke Poland of 
Vermont analyzed § 1 on June 5 as follows:

     It is essentially declared in the Declaration of Independence
     and in all the provisions of the Constitution.
     Notwithstanding this we know that State laws exist, and
     some of them of very recent enactment, in direct violation
     of these principles. Congress has already shown its desire
     and intention to uproot and destroy all such partial State
     legislation in the passage of what is called the civil rights
     bill.... It certainly seems desirable that no doubt should be
     left existing as to the power of Congress to enforce
     principles lying at the foundation of all republican
     government if they be denied or violated by the
     States.[140] (emphasis added)

The references to "all the provisions of the Constitution" and to recently
enacted state laws again show the intent to protect Bill of Rights
freedoms from state violation.

On June 8, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri expounded the concept of 
citizenship by reference to Dred Scott.[141] In Dred Scott, according to 
Henderson, Chief Justice Roger Taney had conceded to members of the state 
communities "all the personal rights, privileges, and immunities guarantied 
to citizens of this 'new Government.' In fact, the opinion distinctly 
asserts that the words 'people of the United States' and 'citizens' are 
'synonymous terms.'"[142] However, Taney had disregarded the plain meaning 
of the term "the people" by excluding blacks.[143]

Taney's opinion also explicitly declared that citizens are entitled to Bill 
of Rights guarantees, including those of the Second Amendment. The following 
passage from Dred Scott particularizes the rights discussed in the passages 
to which Henderson referred and illustrates the objectives sought by the 
Republicans in Congress: "For if they [blacks] were . . . entitled to the 
privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the 
operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they 
considered to be necessary for their own safety. It would give to persons of 
the negro race ... the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon 
all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public 
meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they 
went"[144] (emphasis added). Taney's logic was clear: if blacks were 
citizens, they would have a right to bear arms, and state laws prohibiting 
their possession of firearms would be void.

Senator Johnson favored the citizenship and due process clauses but opposed 
the privileges and immunities clause "because I do not understand what will 
be the effect of that."[145] However, as counsel for the slaveholder in Dred 
Scott, Johnson was fully aware of Taney's characterization of "the right to 
keep and carry arms" as a privilege and immunity of citizenship.[146] 
Johnson also conceded in Senate debate that reports of firearms seizures 
from blacks and other outrages were accurate.[147]

After further debate, the Fourteenth Amendment passed the Senate by a vote 
of 33 to 11,[148] or 75 percent of the votes, far more than the necessary 
two-thirds for a constitutional amendment. On June 13, the House passed the 
proposed Fourteenth Amendment as amended by the Senate by a vote of 120 to 
32,[149] a margin of 79 percent, again far more than the necessary 
two-thirds. 

From all of the above it should be clear that all of the rights recognized 
by the U.S. Constitution are not only rights against state action, but that 
the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes Congress to legislate protection of such 
rights against state action, and grants jurisdiction of the federal 
judiciary over cases between citizens and their states involving them. Among 
those rights are the right to keep and bear arms and the right to a grand 
jury indictment. While the Supreme Court might reasonably have confirmed 
this in any given case by only declaring such rights as are minimally needed 
to render a decision, it is important that they not fail to do so for all 
the rights that are issues before the court.

Republican, May 24, 1866, at 3, col. 1. The Southern Democratic newspapers 
generally did not publish any speeches by Republicans, but their reactions 
to the Howard Amendment are insightful. The amendment's supporters, 
complained the Daily Richmond Examiner, "are first to make citizens and 
voters of the negroes." Yet the Examiner praised Senator Howard for 
objecting to the clause that disenfranchised ex-Confederates. The Southern 
newspapers never claimed that the amendment was unclear, but they objected 
to its breadth in guaranteeing to blacks the rights guaranteed in the first 
eight amendments as well as the right to vote. See Daily Richmond Examiner,
