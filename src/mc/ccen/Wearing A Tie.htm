      <li>Avoid wearing clip-on ties, they are unprofessional.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The front point of your tie should be just long enough to touch the waist 
      of your pants.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>Your tie should be darker than the color of your shirt.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>Avoid wearing ties that are too bright.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The general width of a tie is 3.5 inches, this width will not fall out 
      of style.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The width of a tie should be approximately the same width of the coat&#39;s 
      lapel, if the lapel is wide, the tie should be wide and if the lapel is narrow 
      the tie should be narrow.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The knot of the tie should be proportional to the collar, it should not 
      be too big where it spreads the collar or forces it open and it shouldn&#39;t 
      be too small that it becomes lost in the collar.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The color of your tie should not clash with your outfit but the colors 
      should not be so similar that they fade into the suit.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The main color of a patterned tie should complement your suit and the 
      secondary color should pick up your shirt.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>The texture of the tie should go with your outfit, for instance a shiny 
      silk tie should go with a shiny silk shirt and a wool tie should be worn with 
      a wool suit.</li>

      <h2 align="center">How to Wear a Tie</h2>
      <li>When wearing a shirt, tie and jacket wear up to a maximum of 2 patterned 
      pieces unless you have a very solid fashion sense and know how to mix and 
      match well.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>Tie your tie in front of a mirror to ensure proper tying.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>Make sure your shirt is buttoned up and have the collar up before putting 
      on your tie.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
      <li>Keep the knot of the tie tight throughout the tying process.</li>
