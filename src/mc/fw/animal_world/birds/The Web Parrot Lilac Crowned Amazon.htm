                    Lilac Crown Amazon is a favorite among many, and it&#39;s not surprising. 
                    This parrot has a sweet disposition and is quite lovely to behold. 
                    In addition, he is also an intelligent companion that will provide 
                    his owners with many years of happiness. <br>
                    <br>
                    Best known for his even-tempered disposition, the Lilac Crown 
                    Amazon is a favorite among parrot fanciers. They tend to be 
                    more shy than some of the other Amazon species. There are two 
                    commonly recognized species of this Amazon - the standard Lilac 
                    Crown Amazon, also called &#39;Finsch&#39;s Amazon&#39; (Amazona Finschi 
                    Finschi), and the Sonora Lilac Crowned Amazon (Amazona Finschi 
                    Woodi). The first species will be discussed here. The Lilac 
                    Crown Amazon is not as well known for talking as other Amazons, 
                    such as the Double Yellow Headed Amazon, but some maintain they 
                    are good talkers. Others hold that he usually is not much of 
                    a talker, but some will make surprisingly chatty companions.</div>

                  <div style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
                    Several owners of Lilac Crown Amazons claim their&#39;s not only 
                    talk, but they sing. It is held that the chances for talking 
                    are greatly increased if you raise your Lilac from a baby. There 
                    are of course never any guarantees about talking ability. Even 
                    if your Lilac never utters a word he is still a wonderful pet. 
                    This Amazon does well in homes with families. If they are socialized 
                    well from an early age, they tend to get along well with all 
                    family members; this is often not the case with many other Amazons. 
                    They display a very even temperament that stays throughout adulthood. 
                    Some other breeds of Amazon become very aggressive as they reach 
                    sexual maturity. The Lilac Crown may display a little bad behavior 
                    during his sexual maturity, but in most cases, it passes very 
                    quickly. Their even temperament makes them a great choice in 
                    family households. Like other Amazons, the Lilac can be noisy. 
                    If you want a quiet companion the Lilac Crown Amazon is not 
                    the pet for you. They take great pleasure from making his jungle 
                    noises and he should never be forbidden to do so. Another love 
                    of the Lilac Crown Amazon is chewing. You should provide your 
                    Lilac Crown with a variety of toys in their play area to chew 
                    on. The average lifespan is between 40 and 60 years depending 
                    on care and diet. <br>

                    are slightly smaller than their cousin, the Sonora Lilac Crowned 
                    Amazon. Averaging a mature size of 13 inches (33cm) in length, 
                    they are of medium size compared to other Amazons. His wingspan 
                    ranges from seven to eight inches (185-208mm). Like most amazons, 
                    the primary color of the Lilac Crown is green. His body is accented 
                    in many colors. Greenish yellow feathers can be seen decorating 
                    the front of his crown, abdomen, ear coverlets, chest, and cheeks. 
                    His lores, forehead, and the front of his crown are a reddish 
                    brown or maroon color, while pale blue is seen on his nape and 
                    the sides of his neck. The wings and tail feathers of the Lilac 
                    are quite stunning. The secondary feathers of the wings are 
                    seen in a striking violet blue, with red-wing speculum seen 
                    on the first five feathers. His tail is green with yellow tips, 
                    featuring blue feathers towards the outside of the tail. The 
                    colors of the Lilac Crown mature with age. His feet are gray. 
                    His beak is yellowish, and his eyes possess a lovely orange 
                    iris. <br>

                    The Lilac Crown Amazon originates in Mexico. He is commonly 
                    seen in southwestern Mexico as well as in central western Mexico. 
                    The Lilac Crown Amazon was also named the Finsch&#39;s Amazon, after<img title="Mamacita" height="150" alt="Mamacita" hspace="3" src="The%20Web%20Parrot%20Lilac%20Crowned%20Amazon_files/mamacita1.jpg" width="122" align="right" vspace="2" border="0"> 
                    the person who initially distinguished it as a breed distinct 
                    from the Blue Fronted Amazon. The Lilac Crown does bear a strong 
                    resemblance to other parrot species, such as the Mexican Red 
                    Head and the Green Cheeked Amazon, but closer inspection reveals 
                    several differences.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Lilac Crown LOVES to chew. You must provide him with plenty 
                    of toys for this purpose only. Like other parrots, these are 
                    intelligent creatures and can become bored easily if they are 
                    left alone. For this reason, it is often recommended to leave 
                    a radio or television on for them in your absence. Because of 
                    their intelligence, it is not uncommon for a Lilac Crown to 
                    escape from his cage; make sure that you parrot proof the cage, 
                    so that he does not become an adept escape artist. <br>
                    <br>
                    Like many parrots, the Lilac is susceptible to Psittacosis and 
                    other parrot diseases. A sensible diet, routine health care, 
                    and clean living quarters usually helps to all but eliminate 
                    these problems.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Breeding outside of the wild is often difficult with Lilac Crown 
                    Amazons. The Lilac Crown will display aggression towards other 
                    birds during breeding season and thusly breeding pairs must 
                    be separated at this time. Courtship usually begins in May, 
                    resulting in the hen laying two to four eggs, which take 26 
                    days to hatch. The offspring usually remain in the nest for 
                    54 to 60 days.</div>
