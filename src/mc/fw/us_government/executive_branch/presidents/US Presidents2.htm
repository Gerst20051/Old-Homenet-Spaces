<p>JOHN ADAMS<br>
<br>
Learned and thoughtful, John Adams was more a political philosopher than a politician. 
&quot;People and nations are forged in the fires of adversity,&quot; he said, doubtless thinking 
of his own as well as the American experience. <br>
<br>
Adams was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on October 30, 1735. A Harvard-educated 
lawyer and a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he led in 
the movement for independence. During the Revolutionary War he served in diplomatic 
roles, and helped negotiate the treaty of peace. In 1788 he was elected vice president 
under George Washington.<br>
<br>
Adams&#39;s two terms as vice president were frustrating. He complained to his wife 
Abigail, &quot;My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office 
that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.&quot;<br>
<br>
When Adams became president, the war between the French and British was causing 
partisanship among factions within the nation. His administration focused on France, 
where the Directory, the ruling group, had refused to receive the American envoy 
and had suspended commercial relations. Adams sent commissioners to France, but 
the Directory refused to negotiate unless they were bribed. Adams reported the insult 
and the Senate printed the correspondence, in which the Frenchmen were referred 
to only as &quot;X, Y, and Z. &quot; The nation broke out into what Thomas Jefferson called 
&quot;the X. Y. Z. fever.&quot; The populace cheered itself hoarse wherever the president 
appeared. The Federalists had never been so popular.<br>
<br>
Hostilities began at sea. After several naval defeats, France agreed to receive 
an envoy with respect. Sending a peace mission to France turned the Hamiltonians 
against Adams. In the campaign of 1800, the Republicans were united and the Federalists 
divided. Still, Adams polled only a few less electoral votes than Jefferson, who 
became president. <br>
<br>
Just before the election, Adams had written these words about his new residence, 
the White House: <br>
<br>
&quot;I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall 
hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.&quot;
<br>
<br>
Adams retired to his farm in Quincy. Here on July 4, 1826, he whispered his last 
words: &quot;Thomas Jefferson survives.&quot; But Jefferson had died at Monticello a few hours 
earlier.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THOMAS JEFFERSON<br>
<br>
In the thick of party conflict in 1800, Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;I have sworn upon 
the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of 
man.&quot; <br>
<br>
This powerful advocate of liberty was born On April 13, 1743 in Albermarle County, 
Virginia. He studied at the College of William and Mary, then read law. In 1772 
he married Martha Wayles Skelton and brought her to his partly constructed mountaintop 
home, Monticello.<br>
<br>
Jefferson was eloquent as a correspondent, but he was no public speaker. In the 
Virginia House of Burgesses and the Continental Congress, he contributed his pen 
rather than his voice to the patriot cause. At 33, he drafted the Declaration of 
Independence. <br>
<br>
Jefferson succeeded Benjamin Franklin as minister to France in 1785. When Jefferson 
became secretary of state in President Washington&#39;s Cabinet, his sympathy for the 
French Revolution led him into conflict with Alexander Hamilton. He resigned in 
1793. Sharp political conflict developed and two separate parties, the Federalists 
and the Democratic-Republicans, began to form. Jefferson assumed leadership of the 
Republicans, who empathized with the French cause. Attacking Federalist policies, 
he opposed strong centralized government and championed the rights of states.<br>
<br>
A reluctant candidate for president in 1796, Jefferson came within three votes of 
election. Through a flaw in the Constitution, he became vice president, although 
an opponent of President Adams. When Jefferson assumed the Presidency, the crises 
in France had passed. He slashed army and navy expenditures, cut the budget, eliminated 
the tax on whiskey, yet reduced the national debt by a third. Further, although 
the Constitution made no provision for the acquisition of new land, Jefferson suppressed 
his qualms over constitutionality and acquired the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon 
in 1803.<br>
<br>
During Jefferson&#39;s second term, he was increasingly preoccupied with keeping the 
nation from involvement in the Napoleonic wars, though both England and France interfered 
with the neutral rights of American merchantmen. Jefferson&#39;s attempted solution, 
an embargo upon American shipping, worked badly and was unpopular.<br>
<br>
Jefferson retired to Monticello to ponder such projects as his grand designs for 
the University of Virginia. A French nobleman observed that he had placed his house 
and his mind &quot;on an elevated situation, from which he might contemplate the universe.&quot; 
He died on July 4, 1826.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAMES MADISON<br>
<br>
At his inauguration, James Madison, a small, wizened man, appeared old and worn. 
But whatever his deficiencies, Madison&#39;s wife Dolley compensated for them with her 
warmth and gaiety. She was the toast of Washington.<br>
<br>
Born on March 16, 1751, Madison was raised in Orange County, Virginia, and attended 
Princeton (then called the College of New Jersey). A student of history and government, 
well-read in law, he participated in the framing of the Virginia Constitution in 
1776, served in the Continental Congress, and was a leader in the Virginia Assembly.<br>
<br>
When delegates to the Constitutional Convention assembled at Philadelphia, the 36-year-old 
Madison took part in the debates. He made a major contribution to the ratification 
of the Constitution by writing, with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the Federalist 
essays. Years later, when called the &quot;Father of the Constitution,&quot; Madison said 
that the document was not &quot;the off-spring of a single brain,&quot; but &quot;the work of many 
heads and many hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
In Congress, he helped frame the Bill of Rights. And out of his opposition to Hamilton&#39;s 
financial proposals came the development of the Republican, or Jeffersonian, Party.<br>
<br>
As President Jefferson&#39;s Secretary of State, Madison protested to warring France 
and Britain that their seizure of American ships was contrary to international law. 
Despite the obvious failings of the Embargo Act of 1807, Madison was elected president 
in 1808. <br>
<br>
The difficulties continued with Britain and France. In Congress a young group called 
the &quot;War Hawks&quot; pressed the president for a more militant policy. The British impressments 
of American seamen and the seizure of cargoes impelled Madison to give in to pressure. 
On June 1, 1812, he asked Congress to declare war.<br>
<br>
The young nation was not prepared to fight. The British set fire to the White House 
and the Capitol. But a few notable victories, climaxed by General Andrew Jackson&#39;s 
triumph at New Orleans, convinced Americans that the War of 1812 had been gloriously 
successful. The New England Federalists who had opposed the war – and who had talked 
secession - were so repudiated that Federalism disappeared as a national party.<br>
<br>
In retirement, Madison spoke out against the disruptive states&#39; rights influences 
that by the 1830s threatened to shatter the Federal Union. In a note opened after 
his death in 1836, he stated, &quot;The advice nearest to my heart and deepest in my 
convictions is that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAMES MONROE<br>
<br>
Thomas Jefferson reportedly said of James Monroe that he &quot; …was so honest that if 
you turned his soul inside out there would not be a spot on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on April 28, 1758, Monroe attended the College 
of William and Mary, fought with distinction in the Continental Army, and practiced 
law.<br>
<br>
As a youthful politician, he joined the anti-Federalists in the Virginia Convention 
that ratified the Constitution, and in 1790 was elected to the Senate. As minister 
to France in 1794-1796, he displayed strong sympathies for the French cause. Later, 
with Robert R. Livingston, he helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase.<br>
<br>
His ambition and energy, together with the backing of President Madison, made him 
the Republican choice for the presidency in 1816. He easily won re-election in 1820.
<br>
<br>
Early in his administration, Monroe undertook a goodwill tour. But &quot;goodwill&quot; did 
not endure. Across the facade of nationalism, ugly sectional cracks appeared. Economic 
depression increased the dismay of the Missouri Territory in 1819 when its application 
for admission to the Union as a slave state failed. An amended bill for gradually 
eliminating slavery in Missouri precipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress. 
The Missouri Compromise bill resolved the struggle, pairing Missouri as a slave 
state with Maine, a free state, and barring slavery north and west of Missouri forever.<br>
<br>
In foreign affairs Monroe proclaimed the policy that bears his name. Responding 
to the threat that conservative European governments might help Spain win back former 
Latin American colonies, Monroe did not recognize the young sister republics until 
he could ascertain that Congress would vote appropriations for diplomatic missions.
<br>
<br>
Britain also opposed re-conquest of Latin America and suggested that the United 
States join in proclaiming &quot;hands off.&quot; Ex-Presidents Jefferson and Madison counseled 
Monroe to accept the offer, but Secretary of State John Quincy Adams advised that 
doing so would be &quot;to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Monroe took Adams’ advice. Not only must Latin America be left alone, he warned, 
but the American continents &quot;by the free and independent condition which they have 
assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future 
colonization by any European Power.&quot; Some 20 years after Monroe died in 1831, this 
became known as the Monroe Doctrine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS<br>
<br>
A president who was the son of a president, John Quincy Adams’ career in many 
respects 
paralleled that of his father. Born in Braintree, Massachusetts, on July 11, 1767, 
he watched the Battle of Bunker Hill from a hill above the family farm. As secretary 
to his father in Europe, he became an accomplished linguist and assiduous diarist.
<br>
<br>
After graduating from Harvard College, he became a lawyer. At age 35 he was elected 
to the Senate. Six years later President Madison appointed him minister to Russia. 
Serving under President Monroe, Adams was one of the great secretaries of state. 
He arranged with England for the joint occupation of the Oregon country, obtained 
the cession of the Floridas from Spain and formulated, with the president, the Monroe 
Doctrine.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, secretaries of state were considered the political heirs to the presidency. 
But by 1824 the old ways of choosing a president were giving in to the clamor for 
a popular choice. Within the only party - Republican - sectionalism was developing. 
Each section put up its own candidate for president. No candidate won a majority 
of electoral votes, so the election was decided by the House of Representatives. 
Henry Clay, who favored a program similar to that of Adams, threw his support to 
the New Englander.<br>
<br>
President Adams appointed Clay as secretary of state. Andrew Jackson and his angry 
followers charged that a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; had taken place and immediately began 
their campaign to take the presidency from Adams. Aware that he would face hostility, 
Adams proclaimed in his first annual message a spectacular national program. He 
proposed that the Federal Government bring the sections together with highways and 
canals, and that it develop and conserve the public domain, using funds from the 
sale of public lands. In 1828, he broke ground for the 185-mile C &amp; 0 Canal. Adams 
also established a national university, financed scientific expeditions and erected 
an observatory. His critics declared such measures transcended constitutional limitations.<br>
<br>
In the campaign of 1828, his opponents charged him with corruption and public plunder. 
Adams went home to Massachusetts after his defeat. In 1830, his district elected 
him to the House of Representatives where, above all, he fought against circumscription 
of civil liberties. In 1836 southern congressmen passed a &quot;gag rule&quot; providing that 
the House automatically table petitions against slavery. Adams tirelessly fought 
the rule for eight years until finally he obtained its repeal.<br>
<br>
In 1848, he collapsed on the floor of the House from a stroke. He soon died. To 
the end, &quot;Old Man Eloquent&quot; had fought for what he considered right.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ANDREW JACKSON<br>
<br>
More nearly than any of his predecessors, Andrew Jackson was elected by popular 
vote, and as president he sought to act as the direct representative of the common 
man.<br>
<br>
Born in a backwoods settlement in the Carolinas on March 15, 1767, he read law in 
his teens and became an outstanding young lawyer in Tennessee. Jealous of his honor, 
he engaged in brawls, and in a duel killed a man who cast a slur on his wife Rachel.<br>
<br>
Jackson prospered sufficiently to buy slaves and to build a mansion, the Hermitage, 
near Nashville. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives. 
A major general in the War of 1812, Jackson became a national hero when he defeated 
the British at New Orleans. In 1824 political factions rallied around Jackson, and 
by 1828 &quot;Old Hickory&quot; won enough state elections to become president by popular 
demand.<br>
<br>
In his first annual message to Congress, Jackson recommended eliminating the Electoral 
College. He tried to democratize federal office holding, saying that offices should 
rotate among deserving applicants. Jackson polarized politics, and two parties grew 
out of the old Republican Party - the Democratic Republicans, or Democrats, adhering 
to him; and the National Republicans, or Whigs, opposing him. Whig leaders proclaimed 
themselves defenders of popular liberties against the usurpation of Jackson. Behind 
their accusations lay the fact that Jackson, unlike previous presidents, did not 
defer to Congress in policy-making but used his power of the veto and his party 
leadership to assume command.<br>
<br>
The greatest party battle centered around the Second Bank of the United States, 
a private corporation but virtually a government-sponsored monopoly. Jackson charged 
the Bank with undue economic privilege. His views won approval from the American 
electorate; in 1832 he polled more than 56 percent of the popular vote and almost 
five times as many electoral votes as Whig opponent Henry Clay.<br>
<br>
When South Carolina undertook to nullify a high protective tariff, Jackson ordered 
armed forces to Charleston. Violence seemed imminent until Clay negotiated a compromise: 
tariffs were lowered and South Carolina dropped nullification.<br>
<br>
In January of 1832, the President learned that the Senate had rejected the nomination 
of Martin Van Buren as minister to England. Jackson jumped to his feet and exclaimed, 
&quot;By the Eternal! I&#39;ll smash them!&quot; So he did. His favorite, Van Buren, became vice 
president, and succeeded to the presidency when &quot;Old Hickory&quot; retired to the Hermitage, 
where he died in June 1845.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
MARTIN VAN BUREN</p>
Only about 5 feet, 6 inches tall, but trim and erect, Martin Van Buren’s impeccable 
appearance belied his humble background. Of Dutch descent, he was born on December 
5, 1782, the son of a tavern keeper and farmer, in Kinderhook, New York. <br>
<br>
As a young lawyer he led the &quot;Albany Regency,&quot; a New York political organization. 
He shrewdly dispensed public offices and bounty in a fashion calculated to bring 
votes. Yet he faithfully fulfilled official duties, and in 1821 was elected to the 
United States Senate.<br>
<br>
By 1827 he had emerged as the principal northern leader for Andrew Jackson. President 
Jackson appointed Van Buren secretary of state. He became the president&#39;s most trusted 
adviser. Jackson referred to him as &quot;a true man with no guile.&quot;<br>
<br>
A rift developed in the cabinet because of Jackson&#39;s differences with Vice President 
John C. Calhoun. Martin Van Buren compelled the resignation of the old cabinet. 
To reward him, Jackson appointed Van Buren as minister to Great Britain. Calhoun, 
president of the Senate, cast the deciding vote against the appointment. <br>
<br>
The &quot;Little Magician&quot; was elected vice president on the Jacksonian ticket in 1832, 
and won the presidency in 1836. Van Buren devoted his inaugural address to a discourse 
upon the American experiment as an example to the rest of the world. The country 
was prosperous, but less than three months later the panic of 1837 punctured the 
prosperity.<br>
<br>
To end wild speculation on lands that had swept the West, President Jackson had, 
in 1836, issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with gold or 
silver. In 1837 the panic began. Hundreds of banks and businesses failed. For about 
five years the United States suffered the worst depression thus far in its history. 
Van Buren&#39;s remedy - continuing Jackson&#39;s deflationary policies - only deepened 
and prolonged the depression.<br>
<br>
Van Buren opposed a new Bank of the United States and the placing of federal funds 
in state banks. He fought to establish an independent treasury system to handle 
government transactions. He cut off expenditures so completely that the government 
even sold the tools it had used on public works.<br>
<br>
Inclined more and more to oppose the expansion of slavery, Van Buren blocked the 
annexation of Texas because it assuredly would add to slave territory - and it might 
bring war with Mexico. Defeated by the Whigs in 1840 for reelection, he was an unsuccessful 
candidate for president on the Free Soil ticket in 1848. He died in 1862<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON . 1841<br>
<br>
In 1840 the Whigs presented their candidate, William Henry Harrison, as a simple 
frontier Indian fighter, living in a log cabin and drinking cider, in sharp contrast 
to an aristocratic champagne-sipping Van Buren. <br>
<br>
Harrison was in fact a scion of the Virginia aristocracy. Born at Berkeley on February 
9, 1773, he studied classics and history at Hampden-Sydney College, then began studying 
medicine in Richmond in 1791. That same year, Harrison switched interests. He obtained 
a commission as ensign in the First Infantry of the regular army, and headed Northwest.<br>
<br>
Harrison served as aide-de-camp to General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne at the Battle of 
Fallen Timbers, which opened Ohio to settlement. After resigning from the army in 
1798, he became secretary of the Northwest Territory, was its first delegate to 
Congress, and helped obtain legislation dividing the Territory into the Northwest 
and Indiana Territories. In 1801 he became governor of the Indiana Territory. His 
prime task as governor was to obtain title to Indian lands so settlers could press 
forward into the wilderness. When the Indians retaliated, Harrison was responsible 
for defending the settlements. In 1809, an eloquent and energetic chieftain, Tecumseh, 
with his religious brother, the Prophet, began to strengthen an Indian confederation 
to prevent further encroachment. In 1811 Harrison received permission to attack 
the confederacy.<br>
<br>
While Tecumseh was away seeking allies, Harrison led about a thousand men toward 
the Prophet&#39;s town. Suddenly, before dawn on November 7, the Indians attacked his 
camp on Tippecanoe River. After heavy fighting, Harrison repulsed them, but suffered 
190 dead and wounded. The Battle of Tippecanoe disrupted Tecumseh&#39;s confederacy 
but failed to diminish Indian raids. By the spring of 1812, they were again terrorizing 
the frontier.<br>
<br>
In the War of 1812 Harrison was given the command of the army in the Northwest. 
At the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813, Tecumseh was killed. The Indians 
scattered, never again to offer serious resistance in what was then called the Northwest.<br>
<br>
Harrison returned to civilian life. The Whigs, in need of a national hero, nominated 
him for president in 1840. He won by a majority of less than 150,000, but swept 
the Electoral College, 234 to 60. While Harrison was nationalistic in his outlook, 
he emphasized in his inaugural that he would be obedient to the will of the people 
as expressed through Congress. But before he had been in office a month, he caught 
a cold that developed into pneumonia. On April 4, 1841, he died - the first President 
to die in office - and with him died the Whig program.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JOHN TYLER . 1841-1845<br>
<br>
Dubbed &quot;His Accidency&quot; by his detractors, John Tyler was the first vice president 
to be elevated to the office of president by the death of his predecessor. <br>
<br>
Born in Virginia on March 29,1790, he was raised believing that the Constitution 
must be strictly construed. He never wavered from this conviction. He attended the 
College of William and Mary and studied law.<br>
<br>
Serving in the House of Representatives from 1816 to 1821, Tyler voted against most 
nationalist legislation and opposed the Missouri Compromise. After leaving the House 
he served twice as governor of Virginia. Tyler soon joined the states&#39; rights southerners 
in Congress who banded with the newly formed Whig party opposing President Jackson.<br>
<br>
The Whigs nominated Tyler for vice president in 1840, hoping for support from southern 
states&#39;-righters who could not stomach Jacksonian Democracy. The slogan &quot;Tippecanoe 
and Tyler Too&quot; implied flag-waving nationalism plus a dash of southern sectionalism. 
But suddenly President Harrison was dead, and &quot;Tyler too&quot; was in the White House. 
The Whigs were not too disturbed, as Tyler’s inaugural address seemed full of good 
Whig doctrine. Optimistic that Tyler would accept their program, they were soon 
disillusioned.<br>
<br>
Tyler vetoed Henry Clay&#39;s bill to establish a National Bank with branches in several 
states. A similar bank bill was passed by Congress. But again, on states&#39; rights 
grounds, Tyler vetoed it. In retaliation, the Whigs expelled Tyler from their party. 
All the cabinet resigned but Secretary of State Daniel Webster.<br>
<br>
When Tyler vetoed a tariff bill, the first impeachment resolution against a president 
was introduced in the House of Representatives. A committee headed by John Quincy 
Adams reported that the president had misused the veto power, but the resolution 
failed. In 1842 Tyler did sign a tariff bill protecting northern manufacturers. 
In 1845 Texas was annexed.<br>
<br>
The administration of a states&#39;-righter strengthened the presidency. But it also 
increased sectional cleavage that led to civil war. Tyler returned to the Democratic 
Party, which was committed to the preservation of states&#39; rights, planter interests, 
and the institution of slavery. Whigs became more representative of northern business 
and farming interests.<br>
<br>
When the first southern states seceded in 1861, Tyler led a compromise movement. 
Failing, he worked to create the Southern Confederacy. He died in 1862, a member 
of the Confederate House of Representatives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAMES K. POLK . 1845-1849<br>
<br>
Often called the first &quot;dark horse&quot; president, James K. Polk was the last of the 
Jacksonians to sit in the White House, and the last strong president until the Civil 
War. <br>
<br>
Born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, on November 2, 1795, Polk graduated 
with honors in 1818 from the University of North Carolina. As a young lawyer he 
entered politics, served in the Tennessee legislature, and became a friend of Andrew 
Jackson. In the House of Representatives, he was a chief lieutenant of Jackson in 
his Bank war. Polk served as speaker between 1835 and 1839, leaving to become governor 
of Tennessee.<br>
<br>
Until circumstances raised his ambitions, he was a leading contender for the Democratic 
nomination for vice president in 1844. Martin Van Buren, who had been expected to 
win the Democratic nomination for president, and Henry Clay, who was to be the Whig 
nominee, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas. Polk, however, 
publicly asserted that Texas should be &quot;re-annexed.&quot; The aged Jackson, correctly 
sensing that the people favored expansionism, urged the choice of a candidate committed 
to the nation&#39;s &quot;Manifest Destiny.&quot; So the Democrats nominated Polk instead of Van 
Buren.<br>
<br>
Polk linked the Texas issue, popular in the South, with the Oregon issue attractive 
to the North. He also favored acquiring California. Even before he could take office, 
Congress passed a joint resolution offering annexation to Texas, thus bequeathing 
Polk the possibility of war with Mexico. In his stand on Oregon, the President was 
risking war with Great Britain also. He offered to settle by extending the Canadian 
boundary along the 49th parallel, from the Rockies to the Pacific. When the British 
declined, Polk reasserted the American claim to the entire area up to Russian Alaska. 
The British settled for the 49th parallel, except for Vancouver Island, and the 
treaty was signed in 1846.<br>
<br>
Acquisition of California proved far more difficult. Polk sent an envoy to offer 
Mexico up to $20,000,000, plus settlement of damage claims owed to Americans, in 
return for California and the New Mexico country. Polk&#39;s envoy was not received. 
Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to the disputed area. Mexican troops attacked Taylor&#39;s 
forces. Congress declared war. American forces won repeated victories and occupied 
Mexico City. In 1848, Mexico ceded New Mexico and California in return for $15,000,000 
and American assumption of the damage claims.<br>
<br>
President Polk added a vast area to the United States, but its acquisition precipitated 
a bitter quarrel between the North and the South over expansion of slavery. Polk, 
leaving office with his health undermined from hard work, died in June 1849.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ZACHARY TAYLOR . 1849-1850<br>
<br>
Northerners and southerners disputed whether territories wrested from Mexico should 
be opened to slavery, and some southerners threatened secession. Zachary Taylor 
was prepared to hold the Union together by armed force rather than by compromise.
<br>
<br>
Born in Barboursville, Virginia on November 24, 1784, he was raised on a Kentucky 
plantation. A career officer in the army, he made his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
and owned a plantation in Mississippi. But Taylor did not defend slavery or southern 
sectionalism. 40 years in the army made him a firm nationalist. He had policed frontiers 
against Indians and had won major victories in the Mexican War.<br>
<br>
&quot;Old Rough and Ready&#39;s&quot; homespun ways were political assets. His long military record 
would appeal to northerners; his ownership of 100 slaves would lure southern votes. 
He had not committed himself on troublesome issues. The Whigs nominated him to run 
against the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass, who favored letting the residents 
of territories decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery. In protest against 
Taylor and Cass, northerners who opposed extension of slavery into territories formed 
a Free Soil Party and nominated Martin Van Buren. In a close election, the Free 
Soilers pulled enough votes away from Cass to elect Taylor to the presidency.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, people could decide whether they wanted slavery when they drew up 
new state constitutions. Therefore, to end the dispute over slavery in new areas, 
President Taylor urged New Mexico and California to draft constitutions and apply 
for statehood, bypassing the territorial stage. Southerners were furious, since 
neither state constitution was likely to permit slavery; Members of Congress were 
dismayed, since they felt the president was usurping their policy-making prerogatives. 
In addition, Taylor&#39;s solution ignored several acute side issues: the northern dislike 
of the slave market operating in the District of Columbia; and the southern demands 
for a more stringent fugitive slave law.<br>
<br>
In early 1850 Taylor held a conference with southern leaders who threatened secession. 
He told them that those &quot;taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang...with 
less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico.&quot; He never wavered.<br>
<br>
Then events took an unexpected turn. After participating in July 4 ceremonies at 
the Washington Monument, Taylor fell ill. Within five days he was dead. After his 
death, the forces of compromise triumphed, but the war Taylor had been willing to 
face came 11 years later. In it, his only son Richard served as a general in the 
Confederate Army.<br>

MILLARD FILLMORE . 1850-1853 <br>
<br>
In his rise from a log cabin to the White House, Millard Fillmore proved that through 
methodical industry and some competence an uninspiring man could make the American 
dream come true.<br>
<br>
Born in Summerhill, New York on January 7,1800, Fillmore worked on his father&#39;s 
farm. In 1823 he was admitted to the bar; seven years later he moved his law practice 
to Buffalo. Fillmore held state office and for eight years was a member of the House 
of Representatives. In 1848, while comptroller of New York, he was elected vice 
president.<br>
<br>
He presided over the Senate during the months of debates over the Compromise of 
1850. A few days before President Taylor&#39;s death, Fillmore intimated that if there 
should be a tie vote the bill, he would vote in favor of it. Thus his accession 
to the presidency in July 1850 brought an abrupt political shift in the administration. 
Taylor&#39;s cabinet resigned and President Fillmore appointed Daniel Webster as secretary 
of state, thus proclaiming his alliance with the moderate Whigs who favored the 
Compromise.<br>
<br>
A bill to admit California aroused all the violent arguments over the extension 
of slavery. At this critical juncture, President Fillmore announced in favor of 
the Compromise. On August 6, 1850, he sent a message to Congress recommending that 
Texas be paid to abandon her claims to part of New Mexico. This helped influence 
many northern Whigs in Congress away from their insistence upon the Wilmot Proviso 
- the stipulation that all land gained by the Mexican War must be closed to slavery.
<br>
<br>
Stephen A Douglas of Illinois presented five separate bills to the Senate: 1) Admit 
California as a free state. 2) Settle the Texas boundary and compensate her. 3) 
Grant territorial status to New Mexico. 4) Place federal officers at the disposal 
of slaveholders seeking fugitives. 5) Abolish the slave trade in the District of 
Columbia.<br>
<br>
Each measure obtained a majority, and by September 20, President Fillmore had signed 
them into law. The more militant northern Whigs remained irreconcilable, refusing 
to forgive Fillmore for having signed the Fugitive Slave Act. They helped deprive 
him of the presidential nomination in 1852.<br>
<br>
As the Whig Party disintegrated in the 1850&#39;s, Fillmore refused to join the Republican 
Party; but, instead, in 1856 accepted the nomination for president of the Know Nothing, 
or American, Party. Throughout the Civil War he opposed President Lincoln and during 
Reconstruction supported President Johnson. He died in 1874.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FRANKLIN PIERCE . 1853-1857 <br>
<br>
Franklin Pierce became president at a time of apparent tranquillity. The United 
States, by virtue of the Compromise of 1850, seemed to have weathered its sectional 
storm. Pierce, a New Englander, hoped to prevent still another outbreak of that 
storm. But his policies, far from preserving calm, hastened the disruption of the 
Union. <br>
<br>
Born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, on November 23, 1804, Pierce attended Bowdoin 
College. He studied law, then entered politics. He became speaker of the New Hampshire 
legislature. In the 1830s he went to Washington, first as a representative, then 
as a senator. Pierce was proposed for the 1852 presidential nomination. At the Democratic 
Convention, the delegates agreed upon a platform pledging support of the Compromise 
of 1850 and hostility to any efforts to agitate the slavery question. They eliminated 
all the well-known candidates before nominating Pierce, a true &quot;dark horse.&quot; He 
won with a narrow margin of popular votes. But with the sudden death of his only 
son, Pierce found little cause for celebration.<br>
<br>
In his inaugural he proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity at home, and vigor 
in relations with other nations. Pierce had only to make gestures toward expansionism 
to excite the wrath of northerners, who accused him of acting as a cat&#39;s-paw of 
southerners eager to extend slavery into other areas. Therefore he aroused apprehension 
when he pressured Great Britain to relinquish its special interests along part of 
the Central American coast, and even more when he tried to persuade Spain to sell 
Cuba.<br>
<br>
But the most violent renewal of the storm stemmed from the Kansas-Nebraska Act, 
which repealed the Missouri Compromise and reopened the question of slavery in the 
West. This measure, the handiwork of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, grew in part out 
of his desire to promote a railroad from Chicago to California through Nebraska. 
Already, land that now compromises southern Arizona and New Mexico had been purchased 
for a southern transcontinental route. The proposal, to organize western territories 
through which a railroad might run, caused extreme trouble. Douglas provided in 
his bills that the residents of the new territories could decide the slavery question 
for themselves. The result was a rush into Kansas, as southerners and northerners 
vied for control of the territory. Shooting broke out, and &quot;bleeding Kansas&quot; became 
a prelude to the Civil War.<br>
<br>
By the end of his administration, Pierce could claim &quot;a peaceful condition of things 
in Kansas.&quot; But, to his disappointment, the Democrats refused to renominate him, 
turning to the less controversial Buchanan. Pierce returned to New Hampshire, leaving 
his successor to face the rising fury of the sectional whirlwind. He died in 1869.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAMES BUCHANAN . 1857-1861 <br>
<br>
Tall, stately, stiffly formal in the high stock he wore around his jowls, James 
Buchanan was the only president who never married. Born in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania, 
on April 23,1791, Buchanan, a graduate of Dickinson College, was learned in the 
law. After being elected five times to the House of Representatives, he served for 
a decade in the Senate. He became Polk&#39;s secretary of state and Pierce&#39;s minister 
to Great Britain. Service abroad helped to bring Buchanan the Democratic nomination 
in 1856 because it had exempted him from involvement in bitter domestic controversies.
<br>
<br>
As president-elect, he thought the crisis would disappear if he maintained a sectional 
balance in his appointments and could persuade the people to accept constitutional 
law as the Supreme Court interpreted it. The Court was considering the legality 
of restricting slavery in the territories, and two justices hinted to Buchanan what 
the decision would be. Thus, in his inaugural the president referred to the territorial 
question as &quot; a matter of but little practical importance&quot; since the Court was about 
to settle it &quot;speedily and finally.&quot;<br>
<br>
Two days later the Court delivered the Dred Scott decision, asserting that Congress 
had no constitutional power to deprive persons of their property rights in slaves 
in the territories. Southerners were delighted, but the decision created a furor 
in the North.<br>
<br>
When Republicans won a plurality in the House in 1858, every significant bill they 
passed fell before southern votes in the Senate or a presidential veto. The government 
reached a stalemate. Sectional strife rose to such a pitch in 1860 that the Democratic 
Party split into northern and southern wings, each nominating its own candidate 
for the presidency. When the Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln, it was a foregone 
conclusion that he would be elected even though his name appeared on no southern 
ballot. Rather than accept a Republican administration, the southern &quot;fire-eaters&quot; 
advocated secession. President Buchanan, dismayed and hesitant, denied the legal 
right of states to secede but held that the Federal Government legally could not 
prevent them. He hoped for compromise, but secessionist leaders did not want compromise.<br>
<br>
Then Buchanan took a more militant tack. As several cabinet members resigned, he 
appointed northerners, and sent the Star of the West to carry reinforcements to 
Fort Sumter. On January 9, 1861, the vessel was fired upon and driven away.<br>
<br>
Buchanan reverted to a policy of inactivity that continued until he left office. 
In March1861 he retired to his Pennsylvania home Wheatland - where he died seven 
years later - leaving his successor to resolve the frightful issue facing the nation.<br>

<br>
ABRAHAM LINCOLN . 1861-1865 <br>
<br>
Abraham Lincoln warned the South in his inaugural address: &quot;In your hands, my dissatisfied 
fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war.&quot; <br>
<br>
Lincoln thought secession illegal, and was willing to use force to defend federal 
law and the Union. When Confederate batteries fired on Fort Sumter and forced its 
surrender, he called on the states for 75,000 volunteers. The Civil War had begun.<br>
<br>
Born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky, Lincoln was a frontiersman’s 
son, and had to struggle for a living. He made extraordinary efforts to attain knowledge 
while working on a farm and keeping a store in Illinois. He was a captain in the 
Black Hawk War, spent eight years in the Illinois legislature, and rode the circuit 
of courts for many years. In 1858 Lincoln ran against Stephen A. Douglas for senator. 
He lost the election, but in debating with Douglas he gained a national reputation 
that won him the Republican nomination for president in 1860. <br>
<br>
As president, he built the Republican Party into a strong national organization. 
He rallied northern Democrats to the Union cause. On Jan. 1, 1863, he issued the 
Emancipation Proclamation that declared slaves forever free. In dedicating the military 
cemetery at Gettysburg, Lincoln stated, &quot;we here highly resolve that these dead 
shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth 
of freedom - and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall 
not perish from the earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
He won re-election in 1864, as Union military triumphs heralded an end to the war. 
In his planning for peace, the president was flexible and generous, encouraging 
southerners to lay down their arms and join speedily in reunion. The spirit that 
guided him was clearly that of his second inaugural address, now inscribed on one 
wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D. C.:<br>
<br>
&quot;With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God 
gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind 
up the nation&#39;s wounds . . .. &quot;<br>
<br>
On Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated at Ford&#39;s Theatre in Washington 
by John Wilkes Booth, an actor who somehow thought he was helping the South. The 
opposite was the result, for with Lincoln&#39;s death, the possibility of peace with 
magnanimity died.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ANDREW JOHNSON . 1865-1869<br>
<br>
With the assassination of Lincoln, the presidency fell to a southern Jacksonian 
Democrat of pronounced states&#39; rights views. Andrew Johnson was a most unfortunate 
president. Set against him were the Radical Republicans in Congress, brilliantly 
led and ruthless in their tactics. Johnson was no match for them. <br>
<br>
Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, Johnson grew up in poverty. 
He ran a tailor shop in Tennessee. In local debates, he championed the common man 
and vilified the plantation aristocracy. In the 1840s and 50s, as a member of the 
House and the Senate, he advocated a homestead bill to provide a free farm for the 
poor man.<br>
<br>
Johnson remained in the Senate even when Tennessee seceded, making him a hero in 
the North. Lincoln appointed him governor of Tennessee. Republicans, contending 
that their Party was for all loyal men, nominated the southern Democrat for vice 
president in 1864.<br>
<br>
After Lincoln&#39;s death, President Johnson proceeded to reconstruct the former Confederate 
States while Congress was not in session. By the time Congress met in December 1865, 
slavery was being abolished. But &quot;black codes&quot; regulating the freedmen were starting 
to appear. Radical Republicans in Congress, dismayed at restrictions imposed upon 
blacks, moved to change Johnson&#39;s program. Refusing to seat any representative or 
senator from the old Confederacy, they passed measures dealing with freedmen. Johnson 
vetoed the legislation. Congress overrode his veto to pass the Civil Rights Act 
of 1866, establishing Negroes as American citizens and forbidding any discrimination 
against them.<br>
<br>
A few months later Congress submitted to the states the Fourteenth Amendment, which 
specified that no state should &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law.&quot; All the former Confederate States except Tennessee 
refused to ratify the amendment, and there were two bloody race riots in the South. 
The Radical Republicans won an overwhelming victory in congressional elections that 
fall. <br>
<br>
In March 1867, the Radicals effected their own plan of Reconstruction, again placing 
southern states under military rule. They also passed laws placing restrictions 
upon the president. When Johnson allegedly violated one of these, the Tenure of 
Office Act, by dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House voted eleven 
articles of impeachment against him. He was tried by the Senate in the spring of 
1868 and acquitted by one vote.<br>
<br>
In 1875, Tennessee returned Johnson to the Senate. He died a few months later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
ULYSSES S. GRANT . 1869-1877 <br>
<br>
Late in the administration of Andrew Johnson, General Ulysses S. Grant aligned himself 
with the Radical Republicans. He was, as the symbol of Union victory during the 
Civil War, their logical candidate for President in 1868. <br>
<br>
Born on April 27,1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, Grant was the son of a tanner. Graduated 
from West Point, he fought in the Mexican War under General Zachary Taylor. At the 
outbreak of the Civil War, Grant was appointed commander of a volunteer regiment. 
By September 1861, Grant was brigadier general of volunteers. In February 1862, 
he took Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. In April, Grant, now a major general of volunteers, 
fought a bloody battle at Shiloh and came out less well. President Lincoln fended 
off demands for his removal by saying, &quot;I can&#39;t spare this man - he fights.&quot;<br>
<br>
For his next major objective, Grant maneuvered and fought skillfully to win Vicksburg, 
the key city on the Mississippi, and thus cut the Confederacy in two. Then he broke 
the Confederate hold on Chattanooga. Lincoln appointed him general-in-chief in March 
1864. Grant directed Sherman to drive through the South while he himself, with the 
Army of the Potomac, pinned down General Robert E. Lee&#39;s Army of Northern Virginia.
<br>
<br>
Finally, on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House, Lee surrendered. Grant wrote 
out magnanimous terms of surrender that would prevent treason trials.<br>
<br>
As president, Grant presided over the government much as he had run the army. Indeed 
he brought part of his army staff to the White House. He allowed Radical Reconstruction 
to run its course in the South, bolstering it at times with military force. Although 
a man of scrupulous honesty, Grant mistakenly associated with speculators. He uncovered 
their plan to corner the gold market, but was too late to stop the havoc it wrought 
on business. <br>
<br>
During his campaign for re-election in 1872, Grant was attacked by Liberal Republican 
reformers. He called them &quot;narrow-headed men,&quot; their eyes so close together that 
&quot;they can look out of the same gimlet hole without winking.&quot; The General&#39;s friends 
in the Republican Party came to be known proudly as &quot;the Old Guard.&quot;<br>
<br>
After retiring from the presidency, Grant became a partner in a financial firm, 
which went bankrupt. About that time he learned that he had cancer of the throat. 
He started writing his recollections to pay off his debts and provide for his family, 
racing against death to produce a memoir that ultimately earned nearly $450,000. 
Soon after completing the last page, in 1885, he died. <br>

<br>
<br>
RUTHERFORD B. HAYES . 1877-1881 <br>
<br>
Beneficiary of the most fiercely disputed election in American history, Rutherford 
B. Hayes brought to the Executive Mansion dignity, honesty, and moderate reform.
<br>
<br>
Born in Delaware, Ohio on October 4, 1822, Hayes was educated at Kenyon College 
and Harvard Law School. After five years&#39; law practice in Lower Sandusky, he moved 
to Cincinnati, where he flourished as a young Whig lawyer. He fought in the Civil 
War, was wounded in action, and rose to the rank of brevet major general. While 
he was still in the army, Cincinnati Republicans ran him for the House of Representatives. 
He accepted the nomination, but would not campaign, explaining, &quot;an officer fit 
for duty who at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer... ought to be 
scalped.&quot;<br>
<br>
Party loyalty and a good war record made Hayes a Republican presidential candidate 
in 1876. Although many famous Republican speakers, including Mark Twain, stumped 
for him, Hayes expected to lose to Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. The popular vote did 
go to Tilden - 4,300,000 to 4,036,000 - but a loophole left the final outcome depending 
upon contested electoral votes in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida. If every 
one of the disputed votes went to Hayes, he would win the presidency.<br>
<br>
Months of uncertainty followed. In January 1877, an Electoral Commission was established 
to decide the dispute. The commission, comprised of eight Republicans and seven 
Democrats, determined in favor of Hayes by eight to seven. <br>
<br>
As president, Hayes insisted that his appointments be made on merit and not political 
considerations. For his cabinet he chose men of high caliber, but many Republicans 
were outraged because one was an ex-Confederate and another a Liberal Republican.<br>
<br>
Hayes pledged protection of blacks in the South, but also advocated the restoration 
of &quot;wise, honest, and peaceful local self-government.&quot; This meant the withdrawal 
of troops. Hayes hoped such conciliatory policies would lead to the building of 
a &quot;new Republican party&quot; in the South, to which white businessmen and conservatives 
would rally. Many of the leaders of the new South did indeed favor Republican economic 
policies and approved of Hayes&#39;s financial conservatism, but they faced annihilation 
at the polls if they were to join the party of Reconstruction. Hayes and his Republican 
successors were persistent in their efforts but could not win over the &quot;solid South.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hayes had announced in advance that he would serve only one term, and retired to 
Spiegel Grove, his home in Fremont, Ohio, in 1881. He died in 1893. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JAMES A. GARFIELD . 1881 <br>
<br>
The last of the log cabin Presidents, James A. Garfield attacked political corruption, 
winning back for the presidency a measure of prestige it had lost during Reconstruction.
<br>
<br>
Born November 19, 1831, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Garfield lost his father at age 
two. He drove canal boat teams to earn money for an education and graduated from 
Williams College in Massachusetts in 1856. Returning to Ohio, he taught classics 
at the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later Hiram College). He was made its 
president.<br>
<br>
Garfield was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1859 as a Republican. He advocated coercing 
the seceding states back into the Union. In 1862, when Union victories had been 
few, he successfully led a brigade at Middle Creek, Kentucky, against Confederate 
troops. At 31, Garfield became a brigadier general, two years later a major general 
of volunteers. When Ohioans elected him to Congress in 1862, President Lincoln persuaded 
him to resign his commission. It was easier to find major generals than to obtain 
effective Republicans for Congress. Garfield repeatedly won re-election for 18 years.<br>
<br>
At the 1880 Republican Convention, Garfield became the party’s &quot;dark horse&quot; nominee. 
Later, by only 10,000 popular votes, he defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock.
<br>
<br>
As president, Garfield strengthened federal authority over the New York Customs 
House, stronghold of Senator Roscoe Conkling, leader of the Stalwart Republicans. 
When Garfield submitted to the Senate a list of appointments, he named Conkling&#39;s 
arch-rival to run the Customs House. Conkling tried to persuade the Senate to block 
the nomination, and appealed to the Republican caucus to compel its withdrawal. 
But Garfield would not submit: &quot;This…will settle whether...the principal port of 
entry...be under the control of the administration or under the local control of 
a factional senator.&quot;<br>
<br>
In foreign affairs, Garfield&#39;s secretary of state invited all American republics 
to a conference to meet in Washington in 1882. But the conference never took place. 
On July 2, 1881, in a Washington railroad station, an embittered attorney who had 
sought a consular post shot the president.<br>
<br>
Mortally wounded, Garfield lay in the White House for weeks. Alexander Graham Bell, 
inventor of the telephone, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet with an induction 
balance electrical device which he had designed. On September 6, Garfield was taken 
to the New Jersey seaside. For a few days he seemed to be recuperating, but on September 
19, 1881, he died from an infection and internal hemorrhage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHESTER A. ARTHUR . 1881-1885 <br>
<br>
Son of a Baptist preacher who had emigrated from northern Ireland, Arthur was born 
in Fairfield, Vermont, on October 5,1829. He graduated from Union College in 1848, 
taught school, was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in New York City. In the 
Civil War he served as quartermaster general of the State of New York.<br>
<br>
In 1871, when President Grant appointed him collector of the Port of New York, Arthur 
marshaled the 1,000 Customs House employees on behalf of Roscoe Conkling&#39;s Stalwart 
Republican machine. He staffed the Customs House with more workers than it needed, 
retaining them for their merit as party members rather than as government officials. 
President Hayes, attempting to reform the Customs House, ousted Arthur in 1878. 
Conkling and his followers fought for the re-nomination of Grant in 1880. Failing, 
they reluctantly accepted the nomination of Arthur for the vice presidency. <br>
<br>
During his brief tenure as vice president, Arthur stood beside Conkling in his struggle 
against President Garfield. But when Arthur succeeded to the presidency, he was 
eager to prove himself above machine politics. Avoiding old political friends, he 
associated with the elite of Washington, New York and Newport. To the indignation 
of the Stalwart Republicans, Arthur now championed civil service reform. Public 
pressure forced an unwieldy Congress to heed the President. In 1883 it passed the 
Pendleton Act, which established a bipartisan Civil Service Commission and provided 
for a &quot;classified system&quot; that made certain government positions obtainable only 
through competitive written examinations. The system also protected employees against 
removal for political reasons.<br>
<br>
Enacting the first general federal immigration law, Arthur’s administration approved 
a measure in 1882 excluding paupers, criminals and lunatics. Congress suspended 
Chinese immigration for ten years, later making the restriction permanent. Arthur 
also tried to lower tariff rates so the government would not be embarrassed by annual 
surpluses of revenue. But Congress raised about as many rates as it trimmed. When 
Arthur signed the Tariff Act of 1883, angry westerners and southerners looked to 
the Democratic Party for redress, and the tariff emerged as a major political issue 
between the parties.<br>
<br>
Arthur demonstrated as president that he was above factions within the Republican 
Party, if indeed not above the party itself. Perhaps in part his reason was the 
well-kept secret he had known since a year after he succeeded to the presidency, 
that he was suffering from a fatal kidney disease. He ran for the presidential nomination 
in 1884 in order not to appear that he feared defeat, but was not re-nominated. 
He died in 1886.<br>

<br>
<br>
GROVER CLEVELAND . 1885-1889, 1893-1897<br>
<br>
The first Democrat elected after the Civil War, Grover Cleveland was the only president 
to leave the White House and return for a second term four years later. <br>
<br>
One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in Caldwell, 
New Jersey, on March 18,1837. He was raised in upstate New York. As a lawyer in 
Buffalo, he was known for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced 
him. He emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House 
in three years. Cleveland won the presidency with the combined support of Democrats 
and reform Republicans, the &quot;Mugwumps,&quot; who disliked the record of his Republican 
opponent.<br>
<br>
Cleveland pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic group. He vetoed 
many private pension bills to Civil War veterans whose claims were fraudulent. When 
Congress passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military 
service, Cleveland vetoed it. After vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute 
seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas, the president wrote: &quot;Federal 
aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the 
Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . &quot;<br>
<br>
Cleveland angered the railroads by forcing them to return 81,000,000 acres of western 
lands they held by government grant. He then signed the Interstate Commerce Act, 
the first law attempting federal regulation of the railroads. Calling on Congress 
to reduce high protective tariffs, he was told that he had given Republicans an 
issue for the next campaign. He retorted, &quot;What is the use of being elected or reelected 
unless you stand for something?&quot; Cleveland was defeated in 1888 by Republican Benjamin 
Harrison. <br>
<br>
Elected again in 1892, Cleveland faced a depression. He dealt directly with the 
Treasury crisis rather than with business failures, farm mortgage foreclosures, 
and unemployment. With the aid of Wall Street, he maintained the Treasury&#39;s gold 
reserve. When railroad strikers in Chicago violated an injunction, Cleveland sent 
federal troops to enforce it. <br>
<br>
His blunt treatment of the railroad strikers stirred the pride of many Americans. 
So did the vigorous way in which he forced Great Britain to accept arbitration of 
a disputed boundary in Venezuela. But his policies during the depression were generally 
unpopular. The Democratic Party deserted him and nominated William Jennings Bryan 
in 1896.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
BENJAMIN HARRISON . 1889-1893<br>
<br>
Nominated for president at the 1888 Republican Convention, Benjamin Harrison conducted 
one of the first &quot;front porch&quot; campaigns, delivering short speeches to delegations 
that visited him in Indianapolis, Indiana. <br>
<br>
Born in North Bend, Ohio, on August 20, 1833, Harrison, grandson of &quot;Old Tippecanoe,&quot; 
attended Miami University in Ohio. He moved to Indianapolis, where he practiced 
law and campaigned for the Republican Party. In the Civil War, he was colonel of 
the 70th Volunteer Infantry. He served in the United States Senate throughout the 
1880s, championing the rights of Indians, homesteaders and Civil War Veterans.<br>
<br>
Once elected president, Harrison was proud of the vigorous foreign policy he helped 
shape. The first Pan American Congress met in Washington in 1889, establishing an 
information center which later became the Pan American Union. At the end of his 
administration, Harrison submitted to the Senate a treaty to annex Hawaii. President 
Cleveland later withdrew it.<br>
<br>
Substantial appropriations bills were signed by Harrison for internal improvements, 
naval expansion and steamship lines. For the first time except in war, Congress 
appropriated a billion dollars. When critics attacked &quot;the billion-dollar Congress,&quot; 
Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed replied, &quot;This is a billion-dollar country.&quot;<br>
<br>
President Harrison also signed the Sherman Anti-Trust act, the first federal act 
attempting to regulate trusts by protecting trade and commerce against &quot;unlawful 
restraints and monopolies.&quot; <br>
<br>
The most perplexing domestic problem Harrison faced was the tariff issue - some 
rates were intentionally prohibitive. He tried to make the high rates more acceptable 
by writing in reciprocity agreements. To cope with the Treasury surplus that the 
high rates had created, he removed the tariff from imported raw sugar and gave sugar 
growers in the United States two cents a pound bounty on their production. Long 
before the end of his term, the Treasury surplus had evaporated, and prosperity 
seemed about to disappear as well. The Congressional elections of 1892 went stingingly 
against the Republicans, and party leaders moved to abandon Harrison. Nevertheless, 
his party re-nominated him in 1892, but he was defeated by Grover Cleveland. <br>
<br>
After he left office, Harrison, a widower, returned to Indianapolis and married 
his first wife’s former secretary. A dignified elder statesman, he died in 1901.

GROVER CLEVELAND . 1885-1889, 1893-1897<br>
<br>
The first Democrat elected after the Civil War, Grover Cleveland was the only president 
to leave the White House and return for a second term four years later. <br>
<br>
One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in Caldwell, 
New Jersey, on March 18,1837. He was raised in upstate New York. As a lawyer in 
Buffalo, he was known for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced 
him. He emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House 
in three years. Cleveland won the presidency with the combined support of Democrats 
and reform Republicans, the &quot;Mugwumps,&quot; who disliked the record of his Republican 
opponent.<br>
<br>
Cleveland pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic group. He vetoed 
many private pension bills to Civil War veterans whose claims were fraudulent. When 
Congress passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military 
service, Cleveland vetoed it. After vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute 
seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas, the president wrote: &quot;Federal 
aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the 
Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . &quot;<br>
<br>
Cleveland angered the railroads by forcing them to return 81,000,000 acres of western 
lands they held by government grant. He then signed the Interstate Commerce Act, 
the first law attempting federal regulation of the railroads. Calling on Congress 
to reduce high protective tariffs, he was told that he had given Republicans an 
issue for the next campaign. He retorted, &quot;What is the use of being elected or reelected 
unless you stand for something?&quot; Cleveland was defeated in 1888 by Republican Benjamin 
Harrison. <br>
<br>
Elected again in 1892, Cleveland faced a depression. He dealt directly with the 
Treasury crisis rather than with business failures, farm mortgage foreclosures, 
and unemployment. With the aid of Wall Street, he maintained the Treasury&#39;s gold 
reserve. When railroad strikers in Chicago violated an injunction, Cleveland sent 
federal troops to enforce it. <br>
<br>
His blunt treatment of the railroad strikers stirred the pride of many Americans. 
So did the vigorous way in which he forced Great Britain to accept arbitration of 
a disputed boundary in Venezuela. But his policies during the depression were generally 
unpopular. The Democratic Party deserted him and nominated William Jennings Bryan 
in 1896.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
WILLIAM MCKINLEY . 1897-1901<br>
<br>
At the 1896 Republican Convention, in time of depression, wealthy Ohio businessman 
Marcus Alonzo Hanna ensured the nomination William McKinley as &quot;the advance agent 
of prosperity.&quot; <br>
<br>
Born in Niles, Ohio, on January 29, 1843, McKinley briefly attended Allegheny College, 
and was teaching in a country school when the Civil War broke out. A private in 
the Union Army, he was mustered out at the end of the war as a brevet major of volunteers. 
He studied law, opening an office in Canton, Ohio.<br>
<br>
At 34, McKinley won a seat in Congress. His attractive personality, exemplary character, 
and quick intelligence enabled him to rise rapidly. He was appointed to the powerful 
Ways and Means Committee. During his 14 years in the House, he became the leading 
Republican tariff expert, giving his name to the measure enacted in 1890. The next 
year he was elected governor of Ohio, serving two terms.<br>
<br>
When McKinley became president, he called Congress into special session to enact 
the highest tariff in history. In this friendly atmosphere, industrial combinations 
developed at an unprecedented pace. Newspapers caricatured McKinley as a little 
boy led around by &quot;Nursie&quot; Hanna, the representative of the trusts. However, McKinley 
was not dominated by Hanna; he condemned the trusts as &quot;dangerous conspiracies against 
the public good.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reporting the stalemate between Spanish forces and revolutionaries in Cuba, newspapers 
screamed that a quarter of the population was dead and the rest suffering acutely. 
Public indignation brought pressure upon McKinley for war. He delivered a message 
of neutral intervention in April 1898. Congress thereupon voted three resolutions 
tantamount to a declaration of war for the liberation and independence of Cuba. 
In the 100-day war, the United States destroyed the Spanish fleet outside Santiago 
harbor in Cuba, seized Manila in the Philippines, and occupied Puerto Rico.<br>
<br>
Undecided on what to do about Spanish possessions other than Cuba. McKinley toured 
the country and detected an imperialist sentiment. Thus the United States annexed 
the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. In 1900, Democratic nominee Willliam Jennings 
Bryan inveighed against imperialism; McKinley quietly stood for &quot;the full dinner 
pail.&quot;<br>
<br>
His second term, which had begun so auspiciously, came to a tragic end in September 
1901. He was standing in a receiving line at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition 
when a deranged anarchist shot him twice. He died eight days later. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
THEODORE ROOSEVELT . 1901-1909 <br>
<br>
With the assassination of President McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, not quite 43, 
became the youngest President in the nation&#39;s history. He brought new excitement 
and power to the presidency as he vigorously led Congress and the American public 
toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy. <br>
<br>
Born on October 27, 1858 to a wealthy New York City family, Roosevelt triumphed 
against ill health and became an advocate of the strenuous life. In 1884 his first 
wife and his mother died on the same day, and he spent the next two years on his 
ranch in the Badlands of Dakota Territory mastering his sorrow as he drove cattle 
and hunted big game. During the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt led the Rough Rider 
Regiment on a charge at the battle of San Juan. He was one of the most conspicuous 
heroes of the war.<br>
<br>
As president, Roosevelt held the ideal that the government should be the arbiter 
between capital and labor, guaranteeing justice to each and dispensing favors to 
none. He emerged spectacularly as a &quot;trust buster.&quot; In foreign policy, Roosevelt 
steered the United States more actively into world politics. He liked to quote a 
favorite proverb, &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Aware of the need for a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific, Roosevelt ensured 
the construction of the Panama Canal. He won the Nobel Peace Prize for mediating 
the Russo-Japanese War, reached a Gentleman&#39;s Agreement on immigration with Japan, 
and sent the Great White Fleet on a goodwill tour of the world. But some of Roosevelt&#39;s 
most effective achievements were in conservation. He added enormously to the national 
forests in the West, reserved lands for public use, and fostered great irrigation 
projects. &quot;The life of strenuous endeavor&quot; was a must for those around him, as he 
romped with his children and led ambassadors on hikes through Rock Creek Park in 
Washington, D. C.<br>
<br>
Leaving the presidency in 1909, Roosevelt went on an African safari. In 1912 he 
ran for president on a Progressive ticket. He said that he felt as fit as a bull 
moose, the name of his new party. While campaigning in Milwaukee, he was shot in 
the chest by a fanatic. Roosevelt recovered, but his words at that time would have 
been applicable at his death in 1919: &quot;No man has had a happier life than I have 
led; a happier life in every way.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took the view that the president as a &quot;steward of the people&quot; should take whatever 
action necessary for the public good unless expressly forbidden by law or the Constitution. 
&quot;I did not usurp power,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but I did greatly broaden the use of executive 
power.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT . 1909-1913 <br>
<br>
Distinguished jurist, effective administrator, but poor politician, William Howard 
Taft was caught in the battles between progressives and conservatives and got scant 
credit for the achievements of his administration. <br>
<br>
Born on September 15, 1857, the son of a distinguished Cincinnati judge, Taft graduated 
from Yale, and returned to Ohio to study and practice law. He rose in politics through 
Republican judiciary appointments by his own competence and also, as he once wrote 
facetiously, because he always had his &quot;plate the right side up when offices were 
falling.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taft preferred law to politics, and he aspired to be a member of the Supreme Court. 
His route to the White House was via administrative posts. President McKinley sent 
him to the Philippines in 1900 as chief civil administrator. Sympathetic toward 
the Filipinos, he improved the economy, built roads and schools, and gave the people 
at least some participation in government. President Roosevelt made him secretary 
of war in 1907, and the Republican Convention nominated him the next year.<br>
<br>
Taft disliked the campaign, but pledged his fealty to the Roosevelt program. Progressives 
were pleased with Taft&#39;s election. &quot;Roosevelt has cut enough hay,&quot; they said; &quot;Taft 
is the man to put it into the barn.&quot; Conservatives were delighted to be rid of Roosevelt 
- the &quot;mad messiah.&quot; Taft recognized, too, that his techniques would differ from 
those of his predecessor. Unlike Roosevelt, he did not believe in the stretching 
of presidential powers. <br>
<br>
By defending the Payne-Aldrich Act, which unexpectedly continued high tariff rates, 
Taft alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party. 
He further antagonized progressives by upholding his secretary of the interior, 
accused of failing to carry out Roosevelt’s conservation policies. In the angry 
Progressive onslaught against him, little attention was paid to the fact that his 
administration initiated 80 antitrust suits and that Congress submitted to the states 
amendments for a federal income tax and the direct election of senators. A postal 
savings system was established, and the Interstate Commerce Commission was directed 
to set railroad rates.<br>
<br>
In 1912, when the Republicans re-nominated Taft, Roosevelt bolted the party to lead 
the Progressives, thus guaranteeing the election of Woodrow Wilson. Taft, free of 
the presidency, served as professor of law at Yale until President Harding made 
him chief justice of the United States, a position he held until just before his 
death in 1930. To Taft, the appointment was his greatest honor; he wrote: &quot;I don&#39;t 
remember that I ever was President.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WOODROW WILSON . 1913-1921<br>
<br>
Like Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson saw himself as the personal representative of the 
people. &quot;No one but the President,&quot; he said, &quot;seems to be expected ... to look out 
for the general interests of the country.&quot; <br>
<br>
Wilson was born on December 28, 1856, in Staunton, Virginia. His father was a pastor 
in Augusta, Georgia, during the Civil War and a professor in the city of Columbia, 
South Carolina during Reconstruction, so young Woodrow had seen the frightfulness 
of war. After graduating from Princeton (then the College of New Jersey) and the 
University of Virginia Law School, Wilson earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins 
University and entered upon an academic career. He advanced rapidly as a conservative 
young professor of political science and became president of Princeton in 1902.
<br>
<br>
After becoming governor of New Jersey in 1910, he was nominated for president at 
the 1912 Democratic Convention. Wilson won the campaign on a program called the 
New Freedom, which stressed individualism and states&#39; rights. As president, he passed 
major pieces of legislation through Congress. The first was a lower tariff, the 
Underwood Act; attached to the measure was a graduated federal income tax. The passage 
of the Federal Reserve Act provided the nation with the more elastic money supply 
it badly needed. In 1914 antitrust legislation established a Federal Trade Commission 
to prohibit unfair business practices.<br>
<br>
More legislation came in 1916. One law prohibited child labor; another limited railroad 
workers to an eight-hour day. By virtue of this legislation and the slogan &quot;he kept 
us out of war,&quot; Wilson narrowly won re-election. But after the election, Wilson 
concluded that America could not remain neutral in the World War. On April 2, 1917, 
he asked Congress for a declaration of war on Germany to make the world &quot;safe for 
democracy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Massive American effort slowly tipped the balance in favor of the Allies. After 
the Germans signed the Armistice in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris to try to 
build an enduring peace. He later presented to the Senate the Versailles Treaty, 
containing the Covenant of the League of Nations, and asked, &quot;Dare we reject it 
and break the heart of the world?&quot;<br>
<br>
But the election of 1918 had shifted the balance in Congress to the Republicans. 
By seven votes the Versailles Treaty failed in the Senate. The president, against 
the warnings of his doctors, had made a national tour to mobilize public sentiment 
for the treaty. Exhausted, he suffered a stroke and nearly died. Tenderly nursed 
by his wife, he lived until 1924. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WARREN G. HARDING . 1921-1923 <br>
<br>
Before his nomination, Warren G. Harding declared, &quot;America&#39;s present need is not 
heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; 
not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but 
the dispassionate; not experiment, but equipoise; not submergence in internationality, 
but sustainment in triumphant nationality...&quot; <br>
<br>
One Democratic leader called the speech &quot;an army of pompous phrases moving across 
the landscape in search of an idea.&quot; But its very murkiness was effective, since 
Harding’s pronouncements remained unclear on the League of Nations. Thirty-one distinguished 
Republicans had assured voters that a vote for Harding was a vote for the League. 
But Harding interpreted his election as a mandate to stay out of the League of Nations.<br>
<br>
Born in Corsica, Ohio, on August 2, 1865, Harding&#39;s undeviating Republicanism and 
his willingness to let the machine bosses set policies led him far in that state’s 
politics. He served as lieutenant governor and then ran unsuccessfully for governor. 
In 1914 he was elected to the Senate.<br>
<br>
When the principal candidates of the 1920 Republican Convention deadlocked, a group 
of Senators turned to Harding. He won the presidential election by an unprecedented 
landslide of 60 percent of the popular vote. Republicans in Congress easily got 
the new president&#39;s signature on their bills. They eliminated wartime controls and 
slashed taxes, established a federal budget system, restored the high protective 
tariff, and imposed tight limitations upon immigration. By 1923 the postwar depression 
seemed to be giving way to a new surge of prosperity, and newspapers hailed Harding 
as a wise statesman.<br>
<br>
Behind the façade, word began to reach the president that some of his friends were 
using their official positions for their own enrichment. Harding was alarmed. Looking 
wan and depressed, he journeyed westward in the summer of 1923, taking with him 
his upright secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you knew of a great scandal in our administration,&quot; he asked Hoover, &quot;would 
you for the good of the country and the party expose it publicly or would you bury 
it?&quot; Hoover urged publishing it, but Harding feared the political repercussions.<br>
<br>
He did not live to find out how the public would react to the scandals of his administration. 
In August of 1923, he died in San Francisco of a heart attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CALVIN COOLIDGE . 1923-1929<br>
<br>
At 2:30 on the morning of August 3, 1923, while visiting in Vermont, Calvin Coolidge 
received word that he was president. By the light of a kerosene lamp, his father, 
who was a notary public, administered the oath of office as Coolidge placed his 
hand on the family Bible. <br>
<br>
Born in Plymouth, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, Coolidge was the son of a storekeeper. 
He graduated from Amherst College with honors, and entered law and polities in Northampton, 
Massachusetts. Slowly, methodically, he went up the political ladder from councilman 
to Republican governor of Massachusetts. En route, he became thoroughly conservative.<br>
<br>
As president, Coolidge demonstrated his determination to preserve the old moral 
and economic precepts amid the material prosperity that many Americans were enjoying. 
He refused to use federal economic power to check the growing boom or to ameliorate 
the depressed condition of agriculture and certain industries. His first message 
to Congress in December 1923 called for isolation in foreign policy, tax cuts, and 
limited aid to farmers. He rapidly became popular, and easily won the election in 
the 1924.<br>
<br>
In his inaugural address, he asserted that the country had achieved &quot;a state of 
contentment seldom before seen,&quot; and pledged himself to maintain the status quo. 
In subsequent years he twice vetoed farm relief bills, and killed a plan to produce 
cheap federal electric power on the Tennessee River. The political genius of President 
Coolidge, Walter Lippmann pointed out in 1926, was his talent for effectively doing 
nothing: &quot;This active inactivity …suits all the business interests which want to 
be let alone.... And it suits all those who have become convinced that government 
in this country has become dangerously complicated and top-heavy. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Coolidge was both the most negative and remote of presidents, but no president was 
kinder in permitting himself to be photographed in Indian war bonnets or cowboy 
dress, and in greeting a variety of delegations to the White House. Both his dry 
Yankee wit and his frugality with words became legendary. On August 2, 1927,while 
vacationing in the Black Hills of South Dak<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT . 1933-1945 <br>
<br>
Assuming the presidency at the depth of the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt 
helped Americans regain faith. He brought hope as he promised prompt, vigorous action, 
and asserted in his inaugural address, &quot;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&quot;
<br>
<br>
Born on January 30, 1882, at Hyde Park, New York, he attended Harvard University 
and Columbia Law School. Following the lead of his fifth cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, 
he entered politics. By 1920 he was the Democratic nominee for vice president. In 
1921, at age 39, he was stricken with poliomyelitis, and demonstrated an indomitable 
courage. He dramatically appeared on crutches to nominate Alfred E. Smith at the 
1924 Democratic Convention. In 1928 he became governor of New York.<br>
<br>
He was elected president in 1932. By early 1933 there were 13 million unemployed, 
and almost every bank was closed. He passed a sweeping program to bring relief to 
business, agriculture, the unemployed and those in danger of foreclosure. He created 
the Tennessee Valley Authority. By 1935, the nation was recovering, but businessmen 
and bankers had turned against Roosevelt&#39;s &quot;New Deal.&quot; They disliked his concessions 
to labor and were appalled that he had taken the nation off the gold standard and 
allowed deficits in the budget. The president responded with heavier taxes on the 
wealthy, controls over banks and public utilities, a huge work relief program for 
the unemployed and a new program of reform: Social Security. Re-elected by a top-heavy 
margin in 1936, Roosevelt sought legislation that led to a revolution in constitutional 
law. Thereafter the government could legally regulate the economy.<br>
<br>
He also sought through neutrality legislation to keep the United States out of the 
war in Europe, yet at the same time he pledged by a &quot;good neighbor&quot; policy to strengthen 
nations threatened or attacked. Thus when France fell and England came under siege 
in 1940, he began to send Great Britain all possible aid short of actual military 
involvement. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, though, drove 
Roosevelt to quickly direct the organization of the nation&#39;s manpower and resources 
for global war.<br>
<br>
Feeling that the future peace of the world would depend upon relations between the 
United States and Russia, the president devoted much thought to the planning of 
a United Nations, in which, he hoped, international difficulties could be settled.<br>
<br>
As the war drew to a close, Roosevelt&#39;s health deteriorated, and on April 12, 1945, 
while at Warm Springs, Georgia, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage. <br>
ota, he issued the most famous of his laconic statements, &quot;I do not choose to run 
for President in 1928.&quot;<br>
<br>
By the time the disaster of the Great Depression hit the country, Coolidge was in 
retirement. Before his death in January 1933, he confided to an old friend, &quot;. . 
. I feel I no longer fit in with these times.&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON . 1841<br>
<br>
In 1840 the Whigs presented their candidate, William Henry Harrison, as a simple 
frontier Indian fighter, living in a log cabin and drinking cider, in sharp contrast 
to an aristocratic champagne-sipping Van Buren. <br>
<br>
Harrison was in fact a scion of the Virginia aristocracy. Born at Berkeley on February 
9, 1773, he studied classics and history at Hampden-Sydney College, then began studying 
medicine in Richmond in 1791. That same year, Harrison switched interests. He obtained 
a commission as ensign in the First Infantry of the regular army, and headed Northwest.<br>
<br>
Harrison served as aide-de-camp to General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne at the Battle of 
Fallen Timbers, which opened Ohio to settlement. After resigning from the army in 
1798, he became secretary of the Northwest Territory, was its first delegate to 
Congress, and helped obtain legislation dividing the Territory into the Northwest 
and Indiana Territories. In 1801 he became governor of the Indiana Territory. His 
prime task as governor was to obtain title to Indian lands so settlers could press 
forward into the wilderness. When the Indians retaliated, Harrison was responsible 
for defending the settlements. In 1809, an eloquent and energetic chieftain, Tecumseh, 
with his religious brother, the Prophet, began to strengthen an Indian confederation 
to prevent further encroachment. In 1811 Harrison received permission to attack 
the confederacy.<br>
<br>
While Tecumseh was away seeking allies, Harrison led about a thousand men toward 
the Prophet&#39;s town. Suddenly, before dawn on November 7, the Indians attacked his 
camp on Tippecanoe River. After heavy fighting, Harrison repulsed them, but suffered 
190 dead and wounded. The Battle of Tippecanoe disrupted Tecumseh&#39;s confederacy 
but failed to diminish Indian raids. By the spring of 1812, they were again terrorizing 
the frontier.<br>
<br>
In the War of 1812 Harrison was given the command of the army in the Northwest. 
At the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813, Tecumseh was killed. The Indians 
scattered, never again to offer serious resistance in what was then called the Northwest.<br>
<br>
Harrison returned to civilian life. The Whigs, in need of a national hero, nominated 
him for president in 1840. He won by a majority of less than 150,000, but swept 
the Electoral College, 234 to 60. While Harrison was nationalistic in his outlook, 
he emphasized in his inaugural that he would be obedient to the will of the people 
as expressed through Congress. But before he had been in office a month, he caught 
a cold that developed into pneumonia. On April 4, 1841, he died - the first President 
to die in office - and with him died the Whig program.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JOHN TYLER . 1841-1845<br>
<br>
Dubbed &quot;His Accidency&quot; by his detractors, John Tyler was the first vice president 
to be elevated to the office of president by the death of his predecessor. <br>
<br>
Born in Virginia on March 29,1790, he was raised believing that the Constitution 
must be strictly construed. He never wavered from this conviction. He attended the 
College of William and Mary and studied law.<br>
<br>
Serving in the House of Representatives from 1816 to 1821, Tyler voted against most 
nationalist legislation and opposed the Missouri Compromise. After leaving the House 
he served twice as governor of Virginia. Tyler soon joined the states&#39; rights southerners 
in Congress who banded with the newly formed Whig party opposing President Jackson.<br>
<br>
The Whigs nominated Tyler for vice president in 1840, hoping for support from southern 
states&#39;-righters who could not stomach Jacksonian Democracy. The slogan &quot;Tippecanoe 
and Tyler Too&quot; implied flag-waving nationalism plus a dash of southern sectionalism. 
But suddenly President Harrison was dead, and &quot;Tyler too&quot; was in the White House. 
The Whigs were not too disturbed, as Tyler’s inaugural address seemed full of good 
Whig doctrine. Optimistic that Tyler would accept their program, they were soon 
disillusioned.<br>
<br>
Tyler vetoed Henry Clay&#39;s bill to establish a National Bank with branches in several 
states. A similar bank bill was passed by Congress. But again, on states&#39; rights 
grounds, Tyler vetoed it. In retaliation, the Whigs expelled Tyler from their party. 
All the cabinet resigned but Secretary of State Daniel Webster.<br>
<br>
When Tyler vetoed a tariff bill, the first impeachment resolution against a president 
was introduced in the House of Representatives. A committee headed by John Quincy 
Adams reported that the president had misused the veto power, but the resolution 
failed. In 1842 Tyler did sign a tariff bill protecting northern manufacturers. 
In 1845 Texas was annexed.<br>
<br>
The administration of a states&#39;-righter strengthened the presidency. But it also 
increased sectional cleavage that led to civil war. Tyler returned to the Democratic 
Party, which was committed to the preservation of states&#39; rights, planter interests, 
and the institution of slavery. Whigs became more representative of northern business 
and farming interests.<br>
<br>
When the first southern states seceded in 1861, Tyler led a compromise movement. 
Failing, he worked to create the Southern Confederacy. He died in 1862, a member 
of the Confederate House of Representatives.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
JAMES K. POLK . 1845-1849<br>
<br>
Often called the first &quot;dark horse&quot; president, James K. Polk was the last of the 
Jacksonians to sit in the White House, and the last strong president until the Civil 
War. <br>
<br>
Born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, on November 2, 1795, Polk graduated 
with honors in 1818 from the University of North Carolina. As a young lawyer he 
entered politics, served in the Tennessee legislature, and became a friend of Andrew 
Jackson. In the House of Representatives, he was a chief lieutenant of Jackson in 
his Bank war. Polk served as speaker between 1835 and 1839, leaving to become governor 
of Tennessee.<br>
<br>
Until circumstances raised his ambitions, he was a leading contender for the Democratic 
nomination for vice president in 1844. Martin Van Buren, who had been expected to 
win the Democratic nomination for president, and Henry Clay, who was to be the Whig 
nominee, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas. Polk, however, 
publicly asserted that Texas should be &quot;re-annexed.&quot; The aged Jackson, correctly 
sensing that the people favored expansionism, urged the choice of a candidate committed 
to the nation&#39;s &quot;Manifest Destiny.&quot; So the Democrats nominated Polk instead of Van 
Buren.<br>
<br>
Polk linked the Texas issue, popular in the South, with the Oregon issue attractive 
to the North. He also favored acquiring California. Even before he could take office, 
Congress passed a joint resolution offering annexation to Texas, thus bequeathing 
Polk the possibility of war with Mexico. In his stand on Oregon, the President was 
risking war with Great Britain also. He offered to settle by extending the Canadian 
boundary along the 49th parallel, from the Rockies to the Pacific. When the British 
declined, Polk reasserted the American claim to the entire area up to Russian Alaska. 
The British settled for the 49th parallel, except for Vancouver Island, and the 
treaty was signed in 1846.<br>
<br>
Acquisition of California proved far more difficult. Polk sent an envoy to offer 
Mexico up to $20,000,000, plus settlement of damage claims owed to Americans, in 
return for California and the New Mexico country. Polk&#39;s envoy was not received. 
Polk sent General Zachary Taylor to the disputed area. Mexican troops attacked Taylor&#39;s 
forces. Congress declared war. American forces won repeated victories and occupied 
Mexico City. In 1848, Mexico ceded New Mexico and California in return for $15,000,000 
and American assumption of the damage claims.<br>
<br>
President Polk added a vast area to the United States, but its acquisition precipitated 
a bitter quarrel between the North and the South over expansion of slavery. Polk, 
leaving office with his health undermined from hard work, died in June 1849.<br>
<br>
<br>

ZACHARY TAYLOR . 1849-1850<br>
<br>
Northerners and southerners disputed whether territories wrested from Mexico should 
be opened to slavery, and some southerners threatened secession. Zachary Taylor 
was prepared to hold the Union together by armed force rather than by compromise.
<br>
<br>
Born in Barboursville, Virginia on November 24, 1784, he was raised on a Kentucky 
plantation. A career officer in the army, he made his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 
and owned a plantation in Mississippi. But Taylor did not defend slavery or southern 
sectionalism. 40 years in the army made him a firm nationalist. He had policed frontiers 
against Indians and had won major victories in the Mexican War.<br>
<br>
&quot;Old Rough and Ready&#39;s&quot; homespun ways were political assets. His long military record 
would appeal to northerners; his ownership of 100 slaves would lure southern votes. 
He had not committed himself on troublesome issues. The Whigs nominated him to run 
against the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass, who favored letting the residents 
of territories decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery. In protest against 
Taylor and Cass, northerners who opposed extension of slavery into territories formed 
a Free Soil Party and nominated Martin Van Buren. In a close election, the Free 
Soilers pulled enough votes away from Cass to elect Taylor to the presidency.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, people could decide whether they wanted slavery when they drew up 
new state constitutions. Therefore, to end the dispute over slavery in new areas, 
President Taylor urged New Mexico and California to draft constitutions and apply 
for statehood, bypassing the territorial stage. Southerners were furious, since 
neither state constitution was likely to permit slavery; Members of Congress were 
dismayed, since they felt the president was usurping their policy-making prerogatives. 
In addition, Taylor&#39;s solution ignored several acute side issues: the northern dislike 
of the slave market operating in the District of Columbia; and the southern demands 
for a more stringent fugitive slave law.<br>
<br>
In early 1850 Taylor held a conference with southern leaders who threatened secession. 
He told them that those &quot;taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang...with 
less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico.&quot; He never wavered.<br>
<br>
Then events took an unexpected turn. After participating in July 4 ceremonies at 
the Washington Monument, Taylor fell ill. Within five days he was dead. After his 
death, the forces of compromise triumphed, but the war Taylor had been willing to 
face came 11 years later. In it, his only son Richard served as a general in the 
Confederate Army. <br>

<br>
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER . 1953-1961 <br>
<br>
Bringing to the presidency his prestige as commanding general of the forces in Europe 
during World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower obtained a truce in Korea and worked incessantly 
during his two terms to ease the tensions of the Cold War. He pursued the policies 
of &quot;Modern Republicanism,&quot; pointing out as he left office, &quot;America is today the 
strongest, most influential, and most productive nation in the world.&quot; <br>
<br>
Born in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890, and brought up in Kansas, Eisenhower 
was the third of seven sons. Skilled at high school sports, he received an appointment 
to West Point. He excelled in staff assignments in his early army career. After 
Pearl Harbor, he was called to Washington for a war plans assignment. On D-Day, 
1944, he was supreme commander of the troops invading France.<br>
<br>
After the war, he assumed supreme command over the NATO forces assembled in 1951. 
Republican emissaries to his headquarters near Paris persuaded him to run for president 
in 1952. &quot;I like Ike&quot; was an irresistible slogan; Eisenhower won a sweeping victory.<br>
<br>
Negotiating from military strength, he tried to reduce the strains of the Cold War. 
In 1953, the signing of a truce brought an armed peace along the border of South 
Korea. The death of Stalin the same year caused shifts in relations with Russia. 
Both Russia and the United States had developed hydrogen bombs. With the threat 
of such destructive force hanging over the world, Eisenhower, with the leaders of 
the British, French, and Russian governments, met at Geneva in July 1955. The president 
proposed that the United States and Russia exchange blueprints of each other&#39;s military 
establishments. The Russians greeted the proposal with silence, but were so cordial 
that tensions relaxed.<br>
<br>
After suffering a sudden, severe heart attack in September 1955, Eisenhower recovered, 
and in his second term continued most of the New Deal and Fair Deal programs. As 
desegregation of schools began, he used troops to assure compliance with the orders 
of a federal court; he also ordered the complete desegregation of the armed forces. 
&quot;There must be no second class citizens in this country,&quot; he wrote.<br>
<br>
Eisenhower concentrated on maintaining world peace. Before he left office in January 
1961, for his farm in Gettysburg, he urged the necessity of maintaining an adequate 
military strength, but cautioned that vast, long-continued military expenditures 
could breed potential dangers to our way of life. He concluded with a prayer for 
peace &quot;in the goodness of time.&quot; Both themes remained timely and urgent when he 
died, after a long illness, on March 28, 1969. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JOHN F. KENNEDY . 1961-1963<br>
<br>
On November 22, 1963, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was killed by an assassin&#39;s bullets 
as his motorcade wound through Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was the youngest man elected 
president; he was the youngest to die. <br>
<br>
He was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating from Harvard 
in 1940, he entered the navy. In 1943, his PT boat was sunk by a Japanese destroyer, 
and an injured Kennedy led the survivors to safety. Back from the war, he became 
a Democratic congressman for the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate. Recovering 
from back surgery in 1955, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer 
Prize in history. By 1960 John F. Kennedy was a first-ballot nominee for president. 
Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. 
Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first 
Roman Catholic president.<br>
<br>
His inaugural address offered the memorable injunction: &quot;Ask not what your country 
can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.&quot; As president, his economic 
programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War 
II. Responding to ever more urgent demands, he took vigorous action in the cause 
of equal rights, calling for new civil rights legislation. With the Alliance for 
Progress and the Peace Corps, he brought American idealism to the aid of developing 
nations. But the hard reality of the Communist challenge remained.<br>
<br>
Kennedy permitted a band of Cuban exiles, already armed and trained, to invade their 
homeland. The attempt to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro failed. Soon thereafter, 
the Soviet Union renewed its campaign against West Berlin. Kennedy reinforced the 
Berlin garrison and increased the nation&#39;s military strength, including new efforts 
in outer space. Confronted by this reaction, Moscow relaxed pressure in Europe, 
but sought to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. When this was discovered by air 
reconnaissance in October 1962, Kennedy imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons 
bound for Cuba. The Russians backed down and agreed to take the missiles away. The 
American response to the Cuban crisis evidently persuaded Moscow of the futility 
of nuclear blackmail.<br>
<br>
Kennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the spread 
of nuclear weapons and slowing the arms race - a contention which led to the test 
ban treaty of 1963. The months after the Cuban crisis showed significant progress 
toward his goal of &quot;a world of law and free choice, banishing the world of war and 
coercion.&quot; His administration thus saw the beginning of new hope for both the equal 
rights of Americans and the peace of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LYNDON B. JOHNSON . 1963-1969<br>
<br>
In his first years of office, Lyndon B. Johnson obtained passage of one of the most 
extensive legislative programs in the nation&#39;s history. Maintaining collective security, 
he carried on the struggle to restrain Communist encroachment in Viet Nam. <br>
<br>
Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in central Texas, not far from Johnson City, 
which his family had helped settle. He felt the pinch of rural poverty as he grew 
up, working his way through Southwest Texas State Teachers College. He learned compassion 
for the poverty of others when he taught students of Mexican descent. In 1937 he 
campaigned successfully for the House of Representatives on a New Deal platform, 
and during World War II he served in the navy, winning a Silver Star in the South 
Pacific. <br>
<br>
After six terms in the House, Johnson was elected to the Senate. In 1954, he became 
the majority leader and obtained passage of a number of key Eisenhower measures. 
He was elected vice president in 1960. When Johnson was sworn in as President after 
Kennedy was assassinated, he obtained enactment of the measures President Kennedy 
had been urging - a new civil rights bill and a tax cut. He urged the nation &quot;to 
build a great society, a place where the meaning of man&#39;s life matches the marvels 
of man&#39;s labor.&quot;<br>
<br>
After Johnson won the 1964 election The Great Society became his agenda for Congress 
in January 1965. The program advocated aid to education, attack on disease, Medicare, 
urban renewal, beautification, conservation, development of depressed regions, a 
wide-scale fight against poverty, control and prevention of crime and delinquency, 
and removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Congress, at times augmenting or 
amending, enacted the recommendations. Millions of elderly people found succor through 
the 1965 Medicare amendment. Under Johnson, the country also made spectacular explorations 
of space. When three astronauts successfully orbited the moon in December 1968, 
Johnson congratulated them: &quot;You&#39;ve taken ... all of us, all over the world, into 
a new era . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
But two overriding crises had been gaining momentum since 1965. Despite Johnson&#39;s 
best efforts, unrest in black ghettos troubled the nation, and fighting continued 
in Viet Nam. Controversy over the war had become acute by the end of March 1968, 
when the president limited the bombing of North Viet Nam in order to initiate negotiations. 
At the same time, he startled the world by withdrawing as a candidate for re-election 
so that he might devote his full efforts, unimpeded by politics, to the quest for 
peace.<br>
<br>
When he left office, peace talks were under way; he did not live to see them successful, 
but died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RICHARD M. NIXON . 1969-1974<br>
<br>
During his presidency, Richard Milhous Nixon succeeded in ending American fighting 
in Viet Nam and improving relations with the U.S.S.R. and China. But scandal brought 
fresh divisions to the country and ultimately led to his resignation. <br>
<br>
Born in Yorba Linda, California, on January 9, 1913, Nixon had a brilliant record 
at Whittier College and Duke University Law School before beginning the practice 
of law. In World War II, he served as a navy lieutenant commander in the Pacific. 
On leaving the service, he was elected to Congress from his California district. 
In 1950, he won a Senate seat. Two years later, General Eisenhower selected Nixon, 
age 39, to be his running mate.<br>
<br>
Nominated for president by acclamation in 1960, he lost by a narrow margin to John 
F. Kennedy. In 1968 he won the election. His accomplishments while in office included 
revenue sharing, the end of the draft, new anticrime laws, and a broad environmental 
program. One of the most dramatic events of his first term occurred in 1969, when 
American astronauts made the first moon landing.<br>
<br>
During 1972 visits to Beijing and Moscow, Nixon reduced tensions with China and 
the U.S.S.R. His meetings with Russian leader Leonid I. Brezhnev produced a treaty 
to limit strategic nuclear weapons. In 1973, he announced an accord with North Viet 
Nam to end American involvement in Indochina. His secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, 
negotiated disengagement agreements between Israel and its opponents, Egypt and 
Syria in 1974.<br>
<br>
In his 1972 bid for office, Nixon won by one of the widest margins on record. But 
within a few months, his administration was embattled over the &quot;Watergate&quot; scandal, 
stemming from a break-in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee traced 
to officials of the Committee to Re-elect the President. Nixon denied any personal 
involvement, but the courts forced him to yield tape recordings which indicated 
that he had, in fact, tried to divert the investigation.<br>
<br>
As a result of unrelated scandals in Maryland, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned 
in 1973. Nixon nominated, and Congress approved, House Minority Leader Gerald R. 
Ford as vice president. Then, on August 8, 1974, faced with impeachment, Nixon announced 
that he would resign.<br>
<br>
In his last years, Nixon gained praise as an elder statesman. By the time of his 
death on April 22, 1994, he had written numerous books on his experiences in public 
life and on foreign policy. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HERBERT HOOVER . 1929-1933<br>
<br>
Son of a Quaker blacksmith, Herbert Clark Hoover brought to the presidency an unparalleled 
reputation for public service as an engineer, administrator and humanitarian.
<br>
<br>
Born in West Branch, Iowa on August 10, 1874, he grew up in Oregon. He enrolled 
at Stanford University when it opened in 1891, graduating as a mining engineer. 
He went to China, where he worked for a private corporation as China&#39;s leading engineer. 
In June 1900 the Boxer Rebellion caught Hoover in Tientsin. For almost a month the 
settlement was under heavy fire. While his wife worked in hospitals, Hoover directed 
the building of barricades, and once risked his life rescuing Chinese children.<br>
<br>
When Germany declared war on France, the American consul general asked Hoover’s 
help in getting out stranded tourists. His committee helped 120,000 Americans return 
home. After the United States entered the war, President Wilson appointed him head 
of the Food Administration. He succeeded in cutting consumption of foods needed 
overseas and avoided rationing at home, yet kept the Allies fed. After the Armistice, 
Hoover led the American Relief Administration. In 1921, he aided famine-stricken 
Soviet Russia. Criticized for helping Bolshevism, he retorted, &quot;Twenty million people 
are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!&quot;<br>
<br>
After serving as secretary of commerce under Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Hoover 
became the Republican presidential nominee in 1928. His election seemed to ensure 
prosperity. Yet within months the stock market crashed, and the nation spiraled 
into depression. After the crash Hoover announced that while he would keep the federal 
budget balanced, he would cut taxes and expand public works spending. He asked for 
the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to aid businesses, help farmers 
facing foreclosures, reform banking and feed the unemployed. He also said that while 
people must not suffer, caring for them must be primarily a local and voluntary 
responsibility.<br>
<br>
His opponents in Congress unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel. President 
Hoover became the scapegoat for the depression and was badly defeated in 1932. Throughout 
the 30s he was a powerful critic of the New Deal, warning against tendencies toward 
statism.<br>
<br>
In 1947 President Truman appointed Hoover to a commission to reorganize the Executive 
Departments. He was appointed chairman of a similar commission in 1953 by President 
Eisenhower. Many economies resulted from both commissions&#39; recommendations. Over 
the years, Hoover wrote many articles and books, one of which he was working on 
when he died at 90 in New York City on October 20, 1964. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GERALD R. FORD . 1974-1977<br>
<br>
Taking the oath of office on August 9, 1974, Gerald R. Ford declared, &quot;I assume 
the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances…This is an hour of history that 
troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.&quot; It was indeed an unprecedented time. He 
had been the first vice president chosen under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, 
and he succeeded the first president ever to resign. <br>
Born in Omaha, Nebraska, on July 14, 1913, Ford grew up in Michigan. He went to 
Yale and earned a law degree. During World War II he was a lieutenant commander 
in the navy. After the war he returned to Grand Rapids, where he entered Republican 
politics and was elected to Congress in 1948. He served there for 25 years, earning 
a reputation for integrity and openness. From 1965 to 1973, he was House minority 
leader.<br>
<br>
As president, Ford tried to calm earlier controversies by granting former President 
Nixon a full pardon. Gradually, he selected a cabinet of his own and began to confront 
the almost insuperable challenges facing his administration. Ford’s first goal was 
to curb inflation. Then, when recession became a serious domestic problem, he shifted 
to measures aimed at stimulating the economy. Still fearing inflation, Ford vetoed 
a number of nonmilitary appropriations bills that would have further increased the 
already heavy budgetary deficit. During his first 14 months as president he vetoed 
39 measures. His vetoes were usually sustained.<br>
<br>
A domestic goal was to help business operate more freely by reducing taxes upon 
it and easing the controls exercised by regulatory agencies. &quot;We …declared our independence 
200 years ago, and we are not about to lose it now to paper shufflers and computers,&quot; 
he said. In foreign affairs Ford acted vigorously to maintain U. S. power and prestige 
after the collapse of Cambodia and South Viet Nam. Preventing a new war in the Middle 
East remained a major objective. By providing aid to both Israel and Egypt, the 
Ford Administration helped persuade the two countries to accept an interim truce 
agreement. Détente with the Soviet Union continued. President Ford and Soviet leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev set new limitations upon nuclear weapons.<br>
<br>
In 1976, President Ford won the Republican nomination for the presidency, but lost 
the election to his Democratic opponent, former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia.<br>
<br>
On Inauguration Day, President Carter began his speech: &quot;For myself and for our 
Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.&quot; A 
grateful people concurred.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
JIMMY CARTER . 1977-1981<br>
<br>
Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government &quot;competent and compassionate.&quot; His achievements 
were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, inflation and continuing tensions, 
it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. <br>
<br>
Carter was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, politics, and 
devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. After graduating 
in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, he served seven years as 
a naval officer. In 1962 he entered Georgia politics, and eight years later was 
elected governor. He emphasized ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal 
of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for president in December 1974 
and began a two-year campaign. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on 
the first ballot. Campaigning hard against President Gerald R. Ford, he won the 
1976 election.<br>
<br>
As president, Carter combated the continuing woes of inflation and unemployment. 
By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million 
jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit. Unfortunately, inflation and interest 
rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. 
Domestically, Carter dealt adeptly with the energy shortage, prompted civil service 
reform, and deregulated the trucking and airline industries. His expansion of the 
national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. 
He also created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, 
and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to government jobs.<br>
<br>
In foreign affairs, Carter’s championing of human rights was coldly received by 
the Soviet Union and some other nations. Through the Camp David agreement of 1978, 
he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He obtained ratification of the 
Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full 
diplomatic relations with the People&#39;s Republic of China and completed negotiation 
of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
But there were setbacks. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension 
of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. News of the hostage seizure of the 
U.S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the administration’s last 14 months. The consequences 
of Iran&#39;s holding Americans captive, along with continuing inflation at home, contributed 
to Carter&#39;s defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over 
the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RONALD REAGAN . 1981-1989<br>
<br>
At the end of his two terms in office, Ronald W. Reagan viewed with satisfaction 
the achievements of his innovative program known as the Reagan Revolution, which 
aimed to reinvigorate the American people and reduce their reliance upon government.
<br>
<br>
Born February 6, 1911, in Tampico, Illinois, Reagan worked his way through Eureka 
College. He studied economics and sociology, played on the football team, and acted 
in school plays. Upon graduation, he became a radio sports announcer. A screen test 
in 1937 won him a Hollywood contract. Over the next 20 years he appeared in 53 films.<br>
<br>
As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over 
the issue of Communism in the film industry. His politics went from liberal to conservative, 
and he toured as a television spokesman for conservatism. He was elected governor 
of California in 1966, then re-elected in 1970 by a margin of a million votes. Reagan 
won the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 and voters, troubled by inflation 
and the year-long confinement of Americans in Iran, swept him into the White House. 
Soon after he took office, he was shot by a would-be assassin, but quickly recovered 
and returned to duty. His grace and wit during the dangerous incident caused his 
popularity to soar.<br>
<br>
Reagan obtained legislation to cut taxes, stimulate economic growth, curb inflation, 
increase employment and strengthen national defense. Even when the strengthening 
of defense forces led to a large deficit, he refused to deviate from his course. 
A renewal of national self-confidence by 1984 helped his administration win a second 
term. In 1986 Reagan obtained an overhaul of the income tax code. At the end of 
his administration, the nation was enjoying its longest recorded period of peacetime 
prosperity without recession or depression.<br>
<br>
In foreign policy, Reagan sought &quot;peace through strength.&quot; In meetings with Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he negotiated a treaty that would eliminate intermediate-range 
nuclear missiles. Reagan declared war against international terrorism, sending American 
bombers against Libya after that country was involved in an attack on American soldiers 
in a West Berlin nightclub. By ordering naval escorts in the Persian Gulf, he maintained 
the free flow of oil during the Iran-Iraq war. In keeping with the Reagan Doctrine, 
he supported anti-Communist insurgencies in Central America, Asia, and Africa.<br>
<br>
He left office in 1989, retiring to his California ranch. Overall, the Reagan years 
saw a restoration of prosperity, and the goal of peace through strength seemed to 
be within grasp. President Ronald Reagan passed away after ten years of Alzheimer&#39;s, 
at 93 years of age.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GEORGE BUSH . 1989-1993<br>
<br>
George Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values 
and a determination to make the United States &quot;a kinder and gentler nation.&quot; In 
his inaugural address he pledged to use American strength as &quot;a force for good.&quot;
<br>
<br>
George Herbert Walker Bush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924. 
He became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover, and on his 18th birthday 
he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the navy when he received 
his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. While on a mission over 
the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot his plane was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft 
fire. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.<br>
<br>
Bush returned from the war and went to Yale University, where he was captain of 
the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked 
on a career in the oil industry of West Texas. He became interested in public service 
and politics and served two terms as a representative to Congress from Texas. Twice 
he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level 
positions, including ambassador to the United Nations, chairman of the Republican 
National Committee and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.<br>
<br>
In 1980 Bush became vice president under Ronald Reagan and in 1988 he won the presidency. 
As president, Bush faced a dramatically changing world. The Cold War had ended, 
the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Communist empire was broken up. The Soviet Union 
ceased to exist, and while Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint 
in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations. In other areas of foreign policy, 
he sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime that was threatening 
the security of the canal. <br>
<br>
But Bush&#39;s greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, 
then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Bush rallied the forces and sent 425,000 
American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks 
of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle, dubbed Desert Storm, routed 
Iraq&#39;s million-man army.<br>
<br>
Despite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush 
was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence 
in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for 
re-election to Democrat William Clinton. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WILLIAM J. CLINTON - 1993 - 2001<p></p>
<p>During the administration of William Jefferson Clinton, the U.S. enjoyed more 
peace and economic well being than at any time in its history. He was the first 
Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second term. He could 
point to the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the lowest inflation in 30 
years, the highest home ownership in the country&#39;s history, dropping crime rates 
in many places, and reduced welfare rolls. He proposed the first balanced budget 
in decades and achieved a budget surplus. As part of a plan to celebrate the millennium 
in 2000, Clinton called for a great national initiative to end racial discrimination.
</p>
<p>After the failure in his second year of a huge program of health care reform, 
Clinton shifted emphasis, declaring &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; He sought 
legislation to upgrade education, to protect jobs of parents who must care for sick 
children, to restrict handgun sales, and to strengthen environmental rules. </p>
<p>President Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, in 
Hope, Arkansas, three months after his father died in a traffic accident. When he 
was four years old, his mother wed Roger Clinton, of Hot Springs, Arkansas. In high 
school, he took the family name. </p>
<p>He excelled as a student and as a saxophone player and once considered becoming 
a professional musician. As a delegate to Boys Nation while in high school, he met 
President John Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden. The encounter led him to 
enter a life of public service. </p>
<p>Clinton was graduated from Georgetown University and in 1968 won a Rhodes Scholarship 
to Oxford University. He received a law degree from Yale University in 1973, and 
entered politics in Arkansas. </p>
<p>He was defeated in his campaign for Congress in Arkansas&#39;s Third District in 
1974. The next year he married Hillary Rodham, a graduate of Wellesley College and 
Yale Law School. In 1980, Chelsea, their only child, was born. </p>
<p>Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General in 1976, and won the governorship 
in 1978. After losing a bid for a second term, he regained the office four years 
later, and served until he defeated incumbent George Bush and third party candidate 
Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential race. </p>
<p>Clinton and his running mate, Tennessee&#39;s Senator Albert Gore Jr., then 44, represented 
a new generation in American political leadership. For the first time in 12 years 
both the White House and Congress were held by the same party. But that political 
edge was brief; the Republicans won both houses of Congress in 1994. </p>
<p>In 1998, as a result of issues surrounding personal indiscretions with a young 
woman White House intern, Clinton was the second U.S. president to be impeached 
by the House of Representatives. He was tried in the Senate and found not guilty 
of the charges brought against him. He apologized to the nation for his actions 
and continued to have unprecedented popular approval ratings for his job as president.
</p>
<p>In the world, he successfully dispatched peace keeping forces to war-torn Bosnia 
and bombed Iraq when Saddam Hussein stopped United Nations inspections for evidence 
of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He became a global proponent for an 
expanded NATO, more open international trade, and a worldwide campaign against drug 
trafficking. He drew huge crowds when he traveled through South America, Europe, 
Russia, Africa, and China, advocating U.S. style freedom. </p>

GEORGE W. BUSH . 2001 - 2009<br>
<br>
When George W. Bush became the 43rd president of the United States, it was the second 
time in American history that a president&#39;s son went on to the White House. John 
Quincy Adams, elected the sixth president in 1824, was the son of second president 
John Adams. John Adams had groomed his son for office, but George H.W. Bush, the 
41st president, was surprised when the eldest of his six children became involved 
in politics. George W. Bush launched his quest for the presidency while serving 
as governor of Texas.<br>
<br>
George W. Bush&#39;s presidential campaign helped redefine the modern Republican Party. 
Making educational excellence his highest priority and calling his governing philosophy 
&quot;compassionate conservatism,&quot; Bush insisted that helping those in need be at the 
center of the national agenda. From the earliest moments of his presidency, he has 
sought the involvement of America&#39;s charities, faith-based organizations, and community 
groups.<br>
<br>
George W. Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1946. The family moved to 
Midland, Texas, when the senior Bush entered the oil exploration business. George 
W. attended Midland public schools and graduated from Andover Academy and Yale. 
In 1975, he received a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard. Returning 
to Texas, he got into the oil business and made an unsuccessful bid for Congress. 
Bush was managing general partner of the Texas Rangers until he ran for governor 
in 1994.<br>
<br>
As Texas governor, Bush did not allow partisan differences to impede progress. He 
was a friend and confidant of leaders of both parties. An overwhelming 1998 re-election 
victory attracted support for him in the Republican presidential primaries. During 
the early part of the 2000 election, Bush enjoyed a double-digit lead over his opponent, 
Vice President Albert Gore Jr. In the fall campaign, the battle evened. The election 
was a standoff. Gore led in the popular vote, but in the Electoral College the contest 
came down to the winner of Florida. There, Bush had a margin of a few hundred votes. 
Gore challenged him in the courts of Florida by asking for recounts in key Democratic 
precincts. Partial recounts and lawsuits finally worked their way up to the United 
States Supreme Court, which ruled in Bush&#39;s favor: the election was judged fair 
and the recounts ended. Bush was declared the winner by a very narrow margin, 271 
electoral votes to 266.<br>
<br>
In his Inaugural Address, President Bush defined his hopes for the nation: &quot;We affirm 
a new commitment to live out our nation&#39;s promise through civility, courage, compassion 
and character.&quot; He challenged each citizen, &quot;What you do is as important as anything 
government does. I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend 
needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your nation beginning with your neighbor.&quot;
