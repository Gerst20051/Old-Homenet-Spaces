              FRANCISCO - Internet search leader Google is snapping up YouTube for 
              $1.65 billion, brushing aside copyright concerns to seize a starring 
              role in the online video revolution.
              <p>The all-stock deal announced Monday unites one of the Internet&#39;s 
              marquee companies with one of its rapidly rising stars. It came just 
              a few hours after YouTube unveiled three separate agreements with 
              media companies to counter the threat of copyright-infringement lawsuits.</p>
              <p>The price makes YouTube Inc., a still-unprofitable startup, by 
              far the most expensive purchase made by Google during its eight-year 
              history. Last year, Google spent $130.5 million buying a total of 
              15 small companies.</p>
              <p>Although some cynics have questioned YouTube&#39;s staying power, Google 
              is betting that the popular video-sharing site will provide it an 
              increasingly lucrative marketing hub as more viewers and advertisers 
              migrate from television to the Internet.</p>
              <p>&quot;This is the next step in the evolution of the Internet,&quot; Google 
              Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt said during a conference call 
              Monday.</p>
              <p>YouTube will continue to retain its brand, its new headquarters 
              in San Bruno and all 67 employees, including co-founders Chad Hurley 
              and Steve Chen. Meanwhile, Google will continue to run a less popular 
              video service on its own site.</p>
              <p>The deal is expected to close before the end of the year.</p>
              <p>&quot;I&#39;m confident that with this partnership we&#39;ll have the flexibility 
              and resources needed to pursue our goal of building the next-generation 
              platform for serving media worldwide,&quot; said Hurley, YouTube&#39;s 29-year-old 
              CEO.</p>
              <p>Schmidt thinks so highly of Hurley and Chen, 27, that he compared 
              them to Google&#39;s now 33-year-old co-founders, Sergey Brin and Larry 
              Page.</p>
              <p>Brin sees the similarities too. &quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine a better 
              fit with another company,&quot; Brin said during Monday&#39;s conference call. 
              &quot;This really reminds me of Google just a few short years ago.&quot;</p>
              <p>The two companies even share a common financial bond: Sequoia Capital, 
              an early Google investor that owns a roughly 30 percent stake in YouTube. 
              Menlo Park-based Sequoia remains a major Google shareholder and retains 
              a seat on the company&#39;s board — factors that might have helped the 
              deal come together after just a week of negotiation.</p>
              <p>YouTube has drawn less flattering comparisons to the original Napster, 
              the once-popular music sharing service that was buried in an avalanche 
              of copyright infringement lawsuits filed by incensed music companies 
              and artists.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>While most videos posted on YouTube are homemade, the site also 
              features volumes of copyrighted material — a problem that has caused 
              some critics to predict the startup eventually would be sued into 
              oblivion.</p>
              <p>But Hurley and Chen have spent months cozying up with major media 
              executives in an effort to convince them that YouTube could help them 
              make more money by helping them connect with the growing number of 
              people who spend most of their free time on the Internet.</p>
              <p>As its negotiations with Google appeared to be near fruition, YouTube 
              on Monday announced new partnerships with Universal Music Group, CBS 
              Corp. and Sony BMG Music Entertainment. Those alliances followed a 
              similar arrangement announced last month with Warner Music Group Inc.</p>
              <p>The truce with Universal represented a particularly significant 
              breakthrough because the world&#39;s largest record company had threatened 
              to sue YouTube for copyright infringement less than a month ago.</p>
              <p>While Google has been hauling away huge profits from the booming 
              search market, it hasn&#39;t been able to become a major player in online 
              video.</p>
              <p>That should change now, predicted Forrester Research analyst Charlene 
              Li. &quot;This gives Google the video play they have been looking for and 
              gives them a great opportunity to redefine how advertising is done,&quot; 
              she said. </p>
              <p>Investors applauded the possible acquisition as Google Inc. shares 
              climbed $8.50 to close at $429 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, then added 
              another $3.11 in extended trading. </p>
              <p>Several other suitors, including Microsoft Corp., Yahoo Inc. (Nasdaq:<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/finance/ap/ap_on_bi_ge/storytext/google_youtube/20553445/*http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=yhoo&d=t">YHOO</a> 
              -
              <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/biz/ap/ap_on_bi_ge/storytext/google_youtube/20553445/*http://biz.yahoo.com/n/y/yhoo.html">
              news</a>) and News Corp., reportedly have discussed a possible YouTube 
              purchase in recent weeks. </p>
              <p>&quot;This deal looks pretty compelling for Google,&quot; said Standard &amp; 
              Poor&#39;s analyst Scott Kessler. &quot;Google has been doing a lot of things 
              right, but they are not sitting on their laurels.&quot; </p>
              <p>Google&#39;s YouTube coup may intensify the pressure on Yahoo to make 
              its own splash by buying Facebook.com, the Internet&#39;s second most 
              popular social-networking site. Yahoo has reportedly offered as much 
              as $1 billion for Palo Alto-based Facebook during months of sporadic 
              talks. </p>
              <p>&quot;Yahoo really needs to step up and do something,&quot; said Roger Aguinaldo, 
              an investment banker who also publishes a dealmaking newsletter called 
              the M&amp;A Advisor. &quot;They are becoming less relevant and looking less 
              innovative with each passing day.&quot; </p>
              <p>Selling to Mountain View-based Google will give YouTube more technological 
              muscle and advertising know-how, as well as generate a staggering 
              windfall for a company that was running on credit card debt just 20 
              months ago. </p>
              <p>To conserve money as it subsisted on $11.5 million in venture capital, 
              YouTube had been based in an austere office above a San Mateo pizzeria 
              until recently moving to more spacious quarters in a neighboring city.
              </p>
              <p>Since the company started in Hurley&#39;s garage in February 2005, 
              YouTube has blossomed into a cultural touchstone that shows more than 
              100 million video clips per day. The video library is eclectic, featuring 
              everything from teenagers goofing off in their rooms to William Shatner 
              singing &quot;Rocket Man&quot; during a 1970s TV show. Most clips are submitted 
              by users. </p>
              <p>YouTube&#39;s worldwide audience was 72.1 million by August, up from 
              2.8 million a year earlier, according to comScore Media Metrix.
              </p>
              <p>Li and Kessler expect even more media companies will be lining 
              up to do business with YouTube now that Google owns it. </p>
              <p>&quot;It&#39;s going to be like, &#39;You can either fight us or you can make 
              money with us,&#39;&quot; Li predicted.</p>

                  MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., October 9, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: 
                  GOOG) announced today that it has agreed to acquire YouTube, the 
                  consumer media company for people to watch and share original 
                  videos through a Web experience, for $1.65 billion in a stock-for-stock 
                  transaction.&nbsp; Following the acquisition, YouTube will operate 
                  independently to preserve its successful brand and passionate 
                  community.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="-1" style="font-family: arial,sans-serif">The acquisition 
                  combines one of the largest and fastest growing online video entertainment 
                  communities with Google&#39;s expertise in organizing information 
                  and creating new models for advertising on the Internet. The combined 
                  companies will focus on providing a better, more comprehensive 
                  experience for users interested in uploading, watching and sharing 
                  videos, and will offer new opportunities for professional content

                  and make it universally accessible and useful,&quot; said Eric Schmidt,

                  with Google, we can benefit from its global reach and technology 
                  leadership to deliver a more comprehensive entertainment experience

                  <p><font size="-1" style="font-family: arial,sans-serif">When

                  video business.&nbsp; YouTube will continue to be based in San

              site for $1.6 billion</font></h2>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Internet search leader 
              Google Inc. is in talks to acquire<img border="0" src="../../../../i/mc/nc/2006/Google%20snaps%20up%20YouTube%20for%20$1.65B/Logo_GooTube.png" align="right" width="225" height="75"> 
              the popular online video site YouTube Inc. for about $1.6 billion, 
              The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing a person familiar 
              with the matter.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Mountain View-based Google and San Mateo-based 
              YouTube are still at a sensitive stage in the discussion, the newspaper 
              reported on its Web site.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The blog TechCrunch had reported on rumors 
              of the acquisition talks. Google and YouTube officials declined comment.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Analysts said a Google acquisition of YouTube 
              would make sense for both companies if the reported talks lead to 
              a deal, especially considering Google’s $10 billion in cash on hand.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">“It’s damn cheap for a company that already 
              has a global presence,” said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst with the San 
              Francisco-based Global Equities Research. “YouTube’s brand identity 
              is no less than Google’s and is no less than Coke’s.”</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">As YouTube’s popularity continues to soar, 
              she said, Google can help make sure the site’s infrastructure can 
              keep pace.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The acquisition would also immediately propel 
              Google to the top of the online video heap. YouTube eclipsed traffic 
              on Google’s video site in February. By July, about 30.5 million people 
              visited YouTube, compared with 9.3 million to Google Video and 5.3 
              million to Yahoo Inc.’s Yahoo Video, according to Nielsen/NetRatings.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">YouTube users watch more that 100 million 
              videos daily.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">Google’s video service lets everyday users 
              post clips, too, and unlike YouTube, Google also gives them the choice 
              of selling video. All YouTube clips are free.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">YouTube was founded in February 2005 by three 
              former employees of eBay Inc.’s PayPal electronic-payment unit, and 
              its chief financial backer is the Silicon Valley venture capital firm 
              Sequoia Capital, which has invested $11.5 million. Sequoia was also 
              an early Google investor.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">The 25-employee YouTube is surging thanks 
              to the increased availability of high-speed Internet connections and 
              gadgets such as camera phones and digital cameras capable of taking 
              video. Most of YouTube offerings are short amateur clips, although 
              professional filmmakers, television networks and even political campaigns 
              have posted materials.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">But many of the site’s videos contain copyright 
              material, putting it at odds with big media companies such as Universal 
              Music Group. YouTube immediately removes videos when copyright holders 
              complain, but analysts said the company is still in a precarious legal 
              position.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">“Google would be taking on all that liability,” 
              Forrester Research analyst Josh Bernoff said.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">But Google also could present a solution, 
              Bernoff said, noting that the software innovator could develop automated 
              systems to block attempts to post copyright materials. He also said 
              Google’s size and clout gives the company much more leverage than 
              YouTube to negotiate deals with copyright holders.</p>
              <p class="textBodyBlack">When rumors circulated earlier this year 
              that some major media companies were interested in buying YouTube, 
              the company’s chief executive, Chad Hurley, said the company was not 
              for sale and a future initial public offering was possible.</p>
