              <p>With the Business and Enterprise versions of Vista, Microsoft is 
              allowing companies to install a ‘Key Management Service’ (KMS), which 
              contacts a server on a company’s network to locally activate those 
              two versions of Vista. </p>
              <p>Microsoft knew that this might happen, so they put in a bit of 
              a failsafe – the activation only lasts for 180 days, thereby stopping 
              users from walking into the office with their computer loaded up with 
              pirate version of Vista Business edition and walking out with a fully 
              activated computer. </p>
              <p>Of course they could, in theory, just take that same computer back 
              into the office on the 179th day and re-activate it, but now that 
              the cat is out of the bag and Microsoft clearly knows of this sneaky 
              ‘workaround’ to their anti-piracy measures, the hackers cannot expect 
              Microsoft to sit on their laurels and just take the piracy lying down.
              </p>
              <p>After all, it’s the pirates that Microsoft wants most this time 
              around. Businesses, governments and users who buy a copy of Windows 
              pre-loaded onto a desktop or notebook computer are well known to be 
              buying a legitimate copy of Windows. It’s what has given Microsoft 
              its massive cash reserves after all, along with millions of legitimate 
              sales of different versions of Office. </p>
              <p>But with little anti-piracy protection on earlier Windows and Office 
              versions, or ones that were trivial to work around, billions of dollars 
              of legitimate sales were lost into the digital mist of cyberspace.
              </p>
              <p>Microsoft’s advances in activation technology have worked wonders 
              at stopping the ‘casual copying’ that pirates have taken for granted 
              for years. Instead, they’ve had to seek out versions of Microsoft’s 
              software with a ‘Volume License Key’, or essentially business versions 
              that did not need activation, but simply a seemingly valid license 
              key. </p>
              <p>Of course, Microsoft knew that this was happening too, and started 
              up the Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) program to catch Windows pirates 
              and stop them from easily getting security updates or from downloading 
              new programs such as IE7, Windows Defender and others. </p>
              <p>So successful is this program still to this day, that Microsoft 
              has finally decided to implement it for Microsoft Office, as we revealed 
              not too long ago on iTWire, with January next year the drop dead date 
              for those with pirate versions of Office wanting to get essential 
              security updates. The program is unsurprisingly titled the ‘Office 
              Genuine Advantage’ (OGA) program. </p>
              <p>The battle with the hackers and pirates will long continue, with 
              Microsoft no doubt about to embark on a stricter policy of checking 
              the activation of copies of Vista and Office 2007 now that news of 
              this hacker workaround is very public knowledge. </p>
              <p>I just hope it doesn’t inconvenience legitimate users who have 
              paid good money to buy the software. There have been glitches with 
              WGA that have seen legit users accused on screen of perhaps having 
              a non-genuine copy. </p>
              <p>If these anti-piracy measures are to be foisted upon us all, as 
              is happening, Microsoft needs to ensure that legitimate users receive 
              an uninterrupted, trouble free experience. After all, that’s the least 
              of the advantages you’d expect from any ‘genuine advantage’ program.

                Back in September, Ars
                <a href="http://arstechnica.com/../../journals/microsoft.ars/2006/9/12/5269">
                discussed</a> two ways that Microsoft volume licensing customers 
                could activate Windows Vista. One method, the Multiple Activation 
                Key (MAK), required that machine keys be authenticated against Microsoft&#39;s 
                servers either through one centralized machine or individually. 
                The second method, a Key Management Service (KMS), only required 
                a centralized server that clients could activate against every 180 
                days. The server itself would host the keys, not the client machines.
                <p>While the KMS is intended to benefit system administrators with 
                several on-site clients, it turns out that the service may also 
                benefit those looking to pirate Windows Vista—at least for now.
                <a href="http://apcmag.com/node/4769">Reports</a> are circulating 
                around the web claiming that a group of hackers have used a VMWare 
                image and a VBS script to simulate a local KMS which can generate 
                valid Vista product keys. Because Vista&#39;s Home and Ultimate editions 
                cannot work with a KMS, they cannot be pirated. On the other hand, 
                both Enterprise and Business editions of Vista can easily be activated 
                with the &quot;Microsoft.Windows.Vista.Local.Activation.Server-MelindaGates&quot; 
                workaround. </p>
                <p>APC Magazine, who first reported on the hack, explains how it 
                works: </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>The download is a VMWare image, and the idea behind it is that 
                  you download and install VMWare Player (a legal free download), 
                  boot the image and use some VBS script (supplied with the activation 
                  server download) to have the client Vista machine get its activation 
                  from the local server. And that&#39;s it — no communication back to 
                  Microsoft. </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Although this hack shows that Vista can be tricked into activating, 
                it is still <em>just</em> a workaround for enterprise activation. 
                Ultimately, I have to believe that Microsoft will find a way to 
                prevent this from happening in the future. Plus, even a system activated 
                with this method must be reactivated every 180 days and cannot go 
                through any sort of Windows Genuine Advantage check without some 
                tampering. </p>
                <p>Not to downplay the fact that there is now a way to pirate Vista, 
                but in some ways, Microsoft should be happy that someone had to 
                create a KMS in order to fool Vista into activating. Inevitably, 
                Vista&#39;s product activation was going to be circumvented. To quote 
                APC&#39;s James Bannan, &quot;the fact that it&#39;s taken the acquisition of 
                a KMS server shows that Vista activation is still holding strong 
                in its own right.&quot; Would you agree? </p>
