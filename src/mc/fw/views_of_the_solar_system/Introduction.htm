<p>Our solar system consists of an average star we call the
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/sun.htm">Sun</a>, the planets

<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/neptune.htm">Neptune</a>, and
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/pluto.htm">Pluto</a>. It includes: the satellites 
of the planets; numerous <a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/comet.htm">comets</a>,
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/asteroid.htm">asteroids</a>, and meteoroids; 
and the interplanetary medium. The Sun is the richest source of electromagnetic 
energy (mostly in the form of heat and light) in the solar system. The Sun&#39;s nearest 
known stellar neighbor is a red dwarf star called Proxima Centauri, at a distance 
of 4.3 <a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/terms.htm#lightyear">light years</a> 
away. The whole solar system, together with the local stars visible on a clear night, 
orbits the center of our home galaxy, a spiral disk of 200 billion stars we call 
the <a HREF="#milky">Milky Way</a>. The Milky Way has two small galaxies orbiting 
it nearby, which are visible from the southern hemisphere. They are called the Large 
Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud. The nearest large galaxy is the
<a HREF="#andromeda">Andromeda Galaxy</a>. It is a spiral galaxy like the Milky 
Way but is 4 times as massive and is 2 million light years away. Our galaxy, one 
of billions of galaxies known, is traveling through intergalactic space. </p>
<p>The planets, most of the satellites of the planets and the asteroids revolve 
around the Sun in the same direction, in nearly circular orbits. When looking down 
from above the Sun&#39;s north pole, the planets orbit in a counter-clockwise direction. 
The planets orbit the Sun in or near the same plane, called the
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/terms.htm#ecliptic"><i>ecliptic</i></a>. 
Pluto is a special case in that its orbit is the most highly inclined (18 degrees) 
and the most highly elliptical of all the planets. Because of this, for part of 
its orbit, Pluto is closer to the Sun than is
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/neptune.htm">Neptune</a>. The axis of rotation 
for most of the planets is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic. The exceptions 
are <a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/uranus.htm">Uranus</a> and
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/pluto.htm">Pluto</a>, which are tipped on 
their sides. </p>
<h3><a NAME="comp">Composition Of The Solar System</a></h3>
<p>The Sun contains 99.85% of all the matter in the Solar System. The planets, which 
condensed out of the same disk of material that formed the Sun, contain only 0.135% 
of the mass of the solar system. Jupiter contains more than twice the matter of 
all the other planets combined. Satellites of the planets, comets, asteroids, meteoroids, 
and the interplanetary medium constitute the remaining 0.015%. The following table 
is a list of the mass distribution within our Solar System. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sun: 99.85% </li>
  <li>Planets: 0.135% </li>
  <li>Comets: 0.01% ? </li>
  <li>Satellites: 0.00005% </li>
  <li><a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/terms.htm#minor">Minor Planets</a>: 
  0.0000002% ? </li>
  <li>Meteoroids: 0.0000001% ? </li>
  <li>Interplanetary Medium: 0.0000001% ? </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><a NAME="space">Interplanetary Space</a></h3>
<p>Nearly all the solar system by volume appears to be an empty void. Far from being 
nothingness, this vacuum of &quot;space&quot; comprises the interplanetary medium. It includes 
various forms of energy and at least two material components: interplanetary dust 
and interplanetary gas. Interplanetary dust consists of microscopic solid particles. 
Interplanetary gas is a tenuous flow of gas and charged particles, mostly protons 
and electrons -- <a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/terms.htm#plasma">plasma</a> 
-- which stream from the <a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/sun.htm">Sun</a>, 
called the <a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/terms.htm#solarwind">solar wind</a>.

<p>The solar wind can be measured by spacecraft, and it has a large effect on comet 
tails. It also has a measurable effect on the motion of spacecraft. The speed of 
the solar wind is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) per second in the vicinity of 
Earth&#39;s orbit. The point at which the solar wind meets the interstellar medium, 
which is the &quot;solar&quot; wind from other stars, is called the heliopause. It is a boundary 
theorized to be roughly circular or teardrop-shaped, marking the edge of the Sun&#39;s 
influence perhaps 100 AU from the Sun. The space within the boundary of the heliopause, 
containing the Sun and solar system, is referred to as the heliosphere. </p>
<p>The solar magnetic field extends outward into interplanetary space; it can be 
measured on Earth and by spacecraft. The solar magnetic field is the dominating 
magnetic field throughout the interplanetary regions of the solar system, except 
in the immediate environment of planets which have their own magnetic fields.

<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/venus.htm">Venus</a>,
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/earth.htm">Earth</a> and
<a HREF="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/mars.htm">Mars</a>. They are called terrestrial 
because they have a compact, rocky surface like the Earth&#39;s. The planets, Venus, 
Earth, and Mars have significant atmospheres while Mercury has almost none. The

Sun. </p>

<b>Our Milkyway Galaxy</b> <br>
This image of our galaxy, the Milky Way, was taken with NASA&#39;s Cosmic Background 
Explorer&#39;s (COBE) Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE). This never-before-seen 
view shows the Milky Way from an edge-on perspective with the galactic north pole 
at the top, the south pole at the bottom and the galactic center at the center. 
The picture combines images obtained at several near-infrared wavelengths. Stars 
within our galaxy are the dominant source of light at these wavelengths. Even though 
our solar system is part of the Milky Way, the view looks distant because most of 
the light comes from the population of stars that are closer to the galactic center 
than our own Sun. <i>(Courtesy NASA)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Spiral Galaxy, NGC 4414</b> <br>
The majestic galaxy, NGC 4414, is located 60 million light-years away. Like the 
Milky Way, NGC 4414 is a giant spiral-shaped disk of stars, with a bulbous central 
hub of older yellow and red stars. The outer spiral arms are considerably bluer 
due to ongoing formation of young, blue stars, the brightest of which can be seen 
individually at the high resolution provided by the Hubble camera. The arms are 
also very rich in clouds of interstellar dust, seen as dark patches and streaks 
silhouetted against the starlight. <i>(Courtesy NASA/STSCI)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Obliquity of the Nine Planets</b> <br>
This illustration shows the obliquity of the nine planets. Obliquity is the angle 
between a planet&#39;s equatorial plane and its orbital plane. By International Astronomical 
Union (IAU) convention, a planet&#39;s north pole lies above the ecliptic plane. By 
this convention, Venus, Uranus, and Pluto have a retrograde rotation, or a rotation 
that is in the opposite direction from the other planets. <i>(Copyright 1999 by
