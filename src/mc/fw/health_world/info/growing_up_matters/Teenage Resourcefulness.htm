    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Teenagers need to practice being resourceful if they 
    are to survive in the ever-changing adult world. Giving advice based on our 
    own experience is all too easy for most parents but consider the following:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">How will your teen cope in a crisis if you&#39;re not 
      there? </font></li>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">Is the best solution for you the best solution for 
      your teen?</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">As teens grow older, the likelihood of you, the parent, 
    always being on hand when things go wrong becomes less. Teens start to go out 
    more and more with their friends rather than their family. Temptations are put 
    in their way and <b>your teen</b> has to decide how to deal with, there and 
    then.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">As a parent you need to feel confident that your teen 
    will know how to deal with situations as and when they happen. More importantly,</font>
    <font color="#40AAB7"><b>your teen needs to know how to handle situations confidently 
    and safely.</b> Supporting your teen is all about helping them find their own 
    solution based on their skills not yours. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7"><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div class="header2">
      <font color="#40AAB7">So what needs to change?</font></div>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Teens need to be able to come up with their own solutions. 
    Asking your teen to come up with ideas and possible solutions gets your teen 
    thinking. Getting them to then look at the pros and cons of each option furthers 
    their decision-making skills. In particular, it helps your teen to start thinking 
    about risk and making judgments. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Understanding their own strengths and weaknesses is 
    important for the teen. If the teen over-estimates their ability to cope, it 
    could lead to a greater problem with painful consequences. If the teen underestimates 
    their own ability, it could lead to them being overly dependent on others.
    </font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Consequently, teens need to have feedback not only 
    verbally from parents, teachers, etc on their strengths, but also from experiencing 
    the consequences of their actions. In other words, they also need to take responsibility 
    for their solutions.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Allowing teens to practice this process in increasingly 
    complex, but safe, situations will have them well prepared for when the unexpected 
    does happen and you are not around to support them. ‘You-centred’ listening 
    will help both you and your teen determine exactly how you go about this.</font></p>
