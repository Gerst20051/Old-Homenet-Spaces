<h2 align="center">Part I: The Magic of DOS</h2>
<p align="justify"><tt>In this guide you will learn how to telnet, forge email, 
and use nslookup with Windows XP.<br>
<br>
So you have the newest, glitziest, &quot;Fisher Price&quot; version of Windows: XP. How can 
you use XP in a way that sets you apart from the boring millions of ordinary users?<br>
<br>
****************<br>
<i>Luser Alert</i>: Anyone who thinks this GTMHH will reveal how to blow up people&#39;s 
TV sets and steal Sandra Bullock&#39;s email is going to find out that I won&#39;t tell 
them how. <br>
****************<br>
<br>
The key to doing amazing things with XP is as simple as D O S. Yes, that&#39;s right, 
DOS as in MS-DOS, as in MicroSoft Disk Operating System. Windows XP (as well as 
NT and 2000) comes with two versions of DOS. Command.com is an old DOS version. 
Various versions of command.com come with Windows 95, 98, SE, ME, Window 3, and 
DOS only operating systems. <br>
<br>
The other DOS, which comes only with XP, 2000 and NT, is cmd.exe. Usually cmd.exe 
is better than command.com because it is easier to use, has more commands, and in 
some ways resembles the bash shell in Linux and other Unix-type operating systems. 
For example, you can repeat a command by using the up arrow until you back up to 
the desired command. Unlike bash, however, your DOS command history is erased whenever 
you shut down cmd.exe. The reason XP has both versions of DOS is that sometimes 
a program that won?t run right in cmd.exe will work in command.com<br>
<br>
****************<br>
<i>Flame Alert</i>: Some readers are throwing fits because I dared to compare DOS 
to bash. I can compare cmd.exe to bash if I want to. Nanny nanny nah nah.<br>
****************<br>
<br>
DOS is your number one Windows gateway to the Internet, and the open sesame to local 
area networks. From DOS, without needing to download a single hacker program, you 
can do amazingly sophisticated explorations and even break into poorly defended 
computers.<br>
<br>
****************<br>
You can go to jail warning: Breaking into computers is against the law if you do 
not have permission to do so from the owner of that computer. For example, if your 
friend gives you permission to break into her Hotmail account, that won&#39;t protect 
you because Microsoft owns Hotmail and they will never give you permission.<br>
****************<br>
****************<br>
You can get expelled warning: Some kids have been kicked out of school just for 
bringing up a DOS prompt on a computer. Be sure to get a teacher&#39;s WRITTEN permission 
before demonstrating that you can hack on a school computer.<br>
****************<br>
<br>
<b>So how do you turn on DOS? <br>
</b>Click All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Command Prompt<br>
That runs cmd.exe. You should see a black screen with white text on it, saying something 
like this:<br>
<br>
Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]<br>
(C) Copyright 1985-2001 Microsoft Corp.<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;<br>
<br>
Your first step is to find out what commands you can run in DOS. If you type &quot;help&quot; 
at the DOS prompt, it gives you a long list of commands. However, this list leaves 
out all the commands hackers love to use. Here are some of those left out hacker 
commands. <br>
<br>
TCP/IP commands:<br>
telnet<br>
netstat<br>
nslookup<br>
tracert<br>
ping<br>
ftp<br>
<br>
NetBIOS commands (just some examples):<br>
nbtstat<br>
net use<br>
net view<br>
net localgroup<br>
<br>
<br>
TCP/IP stands for transmission control protocol/Internet protocol. As you can guess 
by the name, TCP/IP is the protocol under which the Internet runs. along with user 
datagram protocol (UDP). So when you are connected to the Internet, you can try 
these commands against other Internet computers. Most local area networks also use 
TCP/IP.<br>
<br>
NetBIOS (Net Basic Input/Output System) protocol is another way to communicate between 
computers. This is often used by Windows computers, and by Unix/Linux type computers 
running Samba. You can often use NetBIOS commands over the Internet (being carried 
inside of, so to speak, TCP/IP). In many cases, however, NetBIOS commands will be 
blocked by firewalls. Also, not many Internet computers run NetBIOS because it is 
so easy to break in using them. We will cover NetBIOS commands in the next Guide 
to XP Hacking.<br>
<br>
The queen of hacker commands is telnet. To get Windows help for telnet, in the cmd.exe 
window give the command:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;telnet /?<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s what you will get:<br>
<br>
telnet [-a][-e escape char][-f log file][-l user][-t term][host<br>
[port]]<br>
-a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempt automatic logon. Same as -l option except 
uses the currently logged on user&#39;s name.<br>
-e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Escape character to enter telnet client prompt.<br>
-f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File name for client side logging<br>
-l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the user name to log in with on the remote 
system. Requires that the remote system support the TELNET ENVIRON option.<br>
-t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies terminal type. Supported term types are 
vt100, vt52, ansi and vtnt only.<br>
host&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the hostname or IP address of the remote computer 
to connect to.<br>
port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies a port number or service name.<br>
<br>
<br>
****************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: what is a port on a computer? A computer port is sort of like 
a seaport. It&#39;s where things can go in and/or out of a computer. Some ports are 
easy to understand, like keyboard, monitor, printer and modem. Other ports are virtual, 
meaning that they are created by software. When that modem port of yours (or LAN 
or ISDN or DSL) is connected to the Internet, your computer has the ability to open 
or close any of over 65,000 different virtual ports, and has the ability to connect 
to any of these on another computer - if it is running that port, and if a firewall 
doesn?t block it.<br>
****************<br>
****************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: How do you address a computer over the Internet? There are two 
ways: by number or by name. <br>
****************<br>
<br>
The simplest use of telnet is to log into a remote computer. Give the command:<br>
<br>
C:/&gt;telnet targetcomputer.com (substituting the name of the computer you want to 
telnet into for targetcomputer.com)<br>
<br>
If this computer is set up to let people log into accounts, you may get the message:<br>
<br>
login: <br>
<br>
Type your user name here, making sure to be exact. You can&#39;t swap between lower 
case and capital letters. For example, user name Guest is not the same as guest.<br>
<br>
****************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: Lots of people email me asking how to learn what their user 
name and password are. Stop laughing, darn it, they really do. If you don&#39;t know 
your user name and password, that means whoever runs that computer didn&#39;t give you 
an account and doesn&#39;t want you to log on.<br>
****************<br>
<br>
Then comes the message:<br>
<br>
Password:<br>
<br>
Again, be exact in typing in your password.<br>
<br>
What if this doesn&#39;t work?<br>
<br>
Every day people write to me complaining they can&#39;t telnet. That is usually because 
they try to telnet into a computer, or a port on a computer that is set up to refuse 
telnet connections.&nbsp; Here&#39;s what it might look like when a computer refuses 
a telnet connection:<br>
<br>
C:\ &gt;telnet 10.0.0.3<br>
Connecting To 10.0.0.3...Could not open connection to the host, on port 23. A connection 
attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period 
of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.<br>
<br>
Or you might see:<br>
<br>
C:\ &gt;telnet techbroker.com<br>
Connecting To techbroker.com...Could not open connection to the host, on port 23. 
No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.<br>
<br>
If you just give the telnet command without giving a port number, it will automatically 
try to connect on port 23, which sometimes runs a telnet server.<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: your Windows computer has a telnet client program, meaning it 
will let you telnet out of it. However you have to install a telnet server before 
anyone can telnet into port 23 on your computer.<br>
*************<br>
<br>
If telnet failed to connect, possibly the computer you were trying to telnet into 
was down or just plain no longer in existence. Maybe the people who run that computer 
don&#39;t want you to telnet into it. <br>
<br>
Even though you can&#39;t telnet into an account inside some computer, often you can 
get some information back or get that computer to do something interesting for you. 
Yes, you can get a telnet connection to succeed -without doing anything illegal 
--against almost any computer, even if you don&#39;t have permission to log in. There 
are many legal things you can do to many randomly chosen computers with telnet. 
For example:<br>
<br>
C:/telnet freeshell.org 22<br>
&nbsp;<br>
SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.4p1<br>
<br>
That tells us the target computer is running an SSH server, which enables encrypted 
connections between computers. If you want to SSH into an account there, you can 
get a shell account for free at <a href="http://freeshell.org">http://freeshell.org</a> 
. You can get a free SSH client program from <a href="http://winfiles.com">http://winfiles.com</a> 
.<br>
<br>
***************<br>
You can get punched in the nose warning: Your online provider might kick you off 
for making telnet probes of other computers. The solution is to get a local online 
provider and make friends with the people who run it, and convince them you are 
just doing harmless, legal explorations.<br>
*************<br>
<br>
Sometimes a port is running an interesting program, but a firewall won&#39;t let you 
in. For example, 10.0.0.3, a computer on my local area network, runs an email sending 
program, (sendmail working together with Postfix, and using Kmail to compose emails). 
I can use it from an account inside 10.0.0.3 to send emails with headers that hide 
from where I send things. <br>
<br>
If I try to telnet to this email program from outside this computer, here&#39;s what 
happens:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;telnet 10.0.0.3 25<br>
Connecting To 10.0.0.3...Could not open connection to the host, on port 25. No connection 
could be made because the target machine actively refused it.<br>
<br>
However, if I log into an account on 10.0.0.3 and then telnet from inside to port 
25, here&#39;s what I get:<br>
<br>
Last login: Fri Oct 18 13:56:58 2002 from 10.0.0.1<br>
Have a lot of fun...<br>
cmeinel@test-box:~&gt; telnet localhost 25<br>
Trying ::1...<br>
telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused<br>
Trying 127.0.0.1... [Carolyn&#39;s note: 127.0.0.1 is the numerical address meaning 
localhost, the same computer you are logged into]<br>
Connected to localhost.<br>
Escape character is &#39;^]&#39;.<br>
220 test-box.local ESMTP Postfix<br>
<br>
The reason I keep this port 25 hidden behind a firewall is to keep people from using 
it to try to break in or to forge email. Now the ubergeniuses reading this will 
start to make fun of me because no Internet address that begins with 10. is reachable 
from the Internet. However, sometimes I place this &quot;test-box&quot; computer online with 
a static Internet address, meaning whenever it is on the Internet, it always has 
the same numerical address. I&#39;m not going to tell you what its Internet address 
is because I don&#39;t want anyone messing with it. I just want to mess with other people&#39;s 
computers with it, muhahaha. That&#39;s also why I always keep my Internet address from 
showing up in the headers of my emails. <br>
<br>
***************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: What is all this about headers? It&#39;s stuff at the beginning 
of an email that may - or may not - tell you a lot about where it came from and 
when. To see full headers, in Outlook click view -&gt; full headers. In Eudora, click 
the &quot;Blah blah blah&quot; icon.<br>
****************<br>
<br>
Want a computer you can telnet into and mess around with, and not get into trouble 
no matter what you do to it? I&#39;ve set up my techbroker.com (206.61.52.33) with user 
xyz, password guest for you to play with. Here&#39;s how to forge email to xyz@techbroker.com 
using telnet. Start with the command:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;telnet techbroker.com 25<br>
Connecting To Techbroker.com<br>
<br>
220 &lt;techbroker.com&gt; Service ready<br>
<br>
Now you type in who you want the message to appear to come from:<br>
<br>
helo santa@techbroker.com<br>
Techbroker.com will answer:<br>
<br>
250 &lt;techbroker.com&gt; host ready<br>
<br>
Next type in your mail from address:<br>
<br>
mail from:santa@techbroker.com<br>
<br>
250 Requested mail action okay, completed<br>
<br>
Your next command:<br>
<br>
rcpt to:xyz@techbroker.com<br>
250 Requested mail action okay, completed<br>
<br>
Your next command:<br>
data<br>
354 Start main input; end with &lt;CRLF&gt;.&lt;CRLF&gt; <br>
<br>
Carolyn&#39;s note: &lt;CRLF&gt; just means hit return. In case you can&#39;t see that little 
period between the &lt;CRLF&gt;s, what you do to end composing your email is to hit enter, 
type a period, then hit enter again. Anyhow, try typing:<br>
<br>
This is a test.<br>
.<br>
250 Requested mail action okay, completed<br>
quit<br>
221 &lt;techbroker.com&gt; Service closing transmission channel<br>
<br>
Connection to host lost.<br>
<br>
Using techbroker&#39;s mail server, even if you enable full headers, the message we 
just composed looks like:<br>
<br>
Status: R<br>
X-status: N<br>
<br>
This is a test.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s a pretty pathetic forged email, huh? No &quot;from&quot;, no date. However, you can 
make your headers better by using a trick with the data command. After you give 
it, you can insert as many headers as you choose. The trick is easier to show than 
explain:<br>
<br>
220 &lt;techbroker.com&gt; Service ready<br>
helo santa@northpole.org<br>
250 &lt;techbroker.com&gt; host ready<br>
mail from:santa@northpole.com<br>
250 Requested mail action okay, completed<br>
rcpt to:cmeinel@techbroker.com<br>
250 Requested mail action okay, completed<br>
data<br>
354 Start main input; end with &lt;CRLF&gt;.&lt;CRLF&gt;<br>
from:santa@deer.northpole.org<br>
Date: Mon, 21 Oct 2002 10:09:16 -0500<br>
Subject: Rudolf<br>
This is a Santa test.<br>
.<br>
250 Requested mail action okay, completed<br>
quit<br>
221 &lt;techbroker.com&gt; Service closing transmission channel<br>
<br>
Connection to host lost.<br>
<br>
The message then looks like:<br>
<br>
from:santa@deer.northpole.org<br>
Date: Mon, 21 Oct 2002 10:09:16 -0500<br>
Subject: Rudolf<br>
This is a Santa test.<br>
<br>
The trick is to start each line you want in the headers with one word followed by 
a colon, and the a line followed by &quot;return&quot;. As soon as you write a line that doesn&#39;t 
begin this way, the rest of what you type goes into the body of the email.<br>
<br>
Notice that the santa@northpole.com from the &quot;mail from:&quot; command didn&#39;t show up 
in the header. Some mail servers would show both &quot;from&quot; addresses.<br>
<br>
You can forge email on techbroker.com within one strict limitation. Your email has 
to go to someone at techbroker.com. If you can find any way to send email to someone 
outside techbroker, let us know, because you will have broken our security, muhahaha! 
Don&#39;t worry, you have my permission.<br>
<br>
Next, you can read the email you forge on techbroker.com via telnet:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;telnet techbroker.com 110<br>
<br>
+OK &lt;30961.5910984301@techbroker.com&gt; service ready<br>
<br>
Give this command:<br>
user xyz<br>
+OK user is known<br>
<br>
Then type in this:<br>
pass test<br>
+OK mail drop has 2 message(s)<br>
<br>
retr 1<br>
+OK message follows<br>
This is a test.<br>
<br>
If you want to know all possible commands, give this command:<br>
<br>
help<br>
+OK help list follows<br>
USER user<br>
PASS password<br>
STAT<br>
LIST [message]<br>
RETR message<br>
DELE message<br>
NOOP<br>
RSET<br>
QUIT<br>
APOP user md5<br>
TOP message lines<br>
UIDL [message]<br>
HELP<br>
<br>
Unless you use a weird online provider like AOL, you can use these same tricks to 
send and receive your own email. Or you can forge email to a friend by telnetting 
to his or her online provider&#39;s email sending computer(s).<br>
<br>
With most online providers you need to get the exact name of their email computer(s). 
Often it is simply mail.targetcomputer.com (substitute the name of the online provider 
for targetcomputer). If this doesn&#39;t work, you can find out the name of their email 
server with the DOS nslookup program, which only runs from cmd.exe. Here&#39;s an example:<br>
<br>
<br>
C:\ &gt;nslookup<br>
Default Server:&nbsp; DNS1.wurld.net<br>
Address:&nbsp; 206.61.52.11<br>
<br>
&gt; set q=mx<br>
&gt; dimensional.com<br>
Server:&nbsp; DNS1.wurld.net<br>
Address:&nbsp; 206.61.52.11<br>
<br>
dimensional.com MX preference = 5, mail exchanger =<br>
mail.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com MX preference = 10, mail exchanger =<br>
mx2.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com MX preference = 20, mail exchanger =<br>
mx3.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com nameserver = ns.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com nameserver = ns-1.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com nameserver = ns-2.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com nameserver = ns-3.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com nameserver = ns-4.dimensional.com<br>
mail.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.11<br>
mx2.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.30<br>
mx3.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 209.98.32.54<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.10<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.26.254<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.254<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.1.254<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 209.98.32.54<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.32<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.30<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.25<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.15<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.21<br>
ns.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.9<br>
ns-1.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.26.254<br>
ns-2.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 209.98.32.54<br>
ns-3.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.1.254<br>
ns-4.dimensional.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 206.124.0.254<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
The lines that tell you what computers will let you forge email to people with @dimensional.com 
addresses are:<br>
<br>
dimensional.com MX preference = 5, mail exchanger =<br>
mail.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com MX preference = 10, mail exchanger =<br>
mx2.dimensional.com<br>
dimensional.com MX preference = 20, mail exchanger =<br>
mx3.dimensional.com<br>
<br>
MX stands for mail exchange. The lower the preference number, the more they would 
like you to use that address for email. If that lowest number server is too busy, 
then try another server.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when you ask about a mail server, nslookup will give you this kind of 
error message:<br>
<br>
DNS request timed out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timeout was 2 seconds.<br>
DNS request timed out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timeout was 2 seconds.<br>
*** Request to [207.217.120.202] timed-out<br>
<br>
To get around this problem, you need to find out what are the domain servers for 
your target online provider. A good place to start looking is
<a href="http://netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois">http://netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois</a> 
. If this doesn&#39;t work, see <a href="http://happyhacker.org/HHA/fightback.shtml">
http://happyhacker.org/HHA/fightback.shtml</a> for how to find the domain servers 
for any Internet address.<br>
<br>
****************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: A domain name server provides information on the names and numbers 
assigned to computers on the Internet. For example, dns1.wurld.net and dns2.wurld.net 
contain information on happyhacker.org, techbroker.com, securitynewsportal.com, 
thirdpig.com and sage-inc.com. When you query dns1.wurld.net about other computers, 
it might have to go hunting for that information from other name servers. That&#39;s 
why you might get a timed out failure.<br>
***************<br>
<br>
Once you know the domain servers for an online service, set one of them for the 
server for your nslookup program. Here&#39;s how you do it:<br>
<br>
C:\ &gt;nslookup<br>
Default Server:&nbsp; DNS1.wurld.net<br>
Address:&nbsp; 206.61.52.11<br>
<br>
Now give the command:<br>
<br>
&gt; server 207.217.126.41<br>
Default Server:&nbsp; ns1.earthlink.net<br>
Address:&nbsp; 207.217.126.41<br>
<br>
Next command should be:<br>
&gt; set q=mx<br>
&gt; earthlink.net<br>
Server:&nbsp; ns1.earthlink.net<br>
Address:&nbsp; 207.217.126.41<br>
<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx04.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx05.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx06.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx00.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx01.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx02.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = mx03.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; nameserver = ns3.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; nameserver = ns1.earthlink.net<br>
earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp; nameserver = ns2.earthlink.net<br>
mx00.earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 207.217.120.28<br>
mx01.earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 207.217.120.29<br>
mx02.earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 207.217.120.79<br>
mx03.earthlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internet address = 207.217.120.78<br>

Your own online service will usually not mind and may even be glad if you use telnet 
to read your email. Sometimes a malicious person or faulty email program will send 
you a message that is so screwed up that your email program can&#39;t download it. With 
telnet you can manually delete the bad email. Otherwise tech support has to do it 
for you.<br>
<br>
If you think about it, this ability to forge email is a huge temptation to spammers. 
How can your online provider keep the bad guys from filling up a victim&#39;s email 
box with garbage? The first time a bad guy tries this, probably nothing will stop 
him or her. The second time the online provider might block the bad guy at the firewall, 
maybe call the bad guy&#39;s online provider and kick him or her and maybe get the bad 
guy busted or sued.<br>

You can go to jail warning: Sending hundreds or thousands of junk emails to bomb 
someone&#39;s email account is a felony in the US.<br>

You can get sued warning: Spamming, where you send only one email to each person, 
but send thousands or millions of emails, is borderline legal. However, spammers 
have been successfully sued when they forge the email addresses of innocent people 
as senders of their spam.<br>

Now that you know how to read and write email with telnet, you definitely have something 
you can use to show off with. Happy hacking!<br>
<br>
Oh, here&#39;s one last goodie for advanced users. Get netcat for Windows. It&#39;s a free 
program written by Weld Pond and Hobbit, and available from many sites, for example<br>
<a href="http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/#network_utilities">http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/#network_utilities</a> 
. It is basically telnet on steroids. For example, using netcat, you can set up 
a port on your Windows computer to allow people to telnet into a DOS shell by using 
this command:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;nc -L -p 5000 -t -e cmd.exe<br>
&nbsp;<br>
You can specify a different port number than 5000. Just make sure it doesn&#39;t conflict 
with another port by checking with the netstat command. Then you and your friends, 
enemies and random losers can either telnet in or netcat in with the command:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;nc -v [ipaddress of target] [port]<br>
<br>
Of course you will probably get hacked for setting up this port. However, if you 
set up a sniffer to keep track of the action, you can turn this scary back door 
into a fascinating honeypot. For example, you could run it on port 23 and watch 
all the hackers who attack with telnet hoping to log in. With some programming you 
could even fake a unix-like login sequence and play some tricks on your attackers.<br>
