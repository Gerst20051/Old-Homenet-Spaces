Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, 
stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. The first 
symptoms of TS are almost always noticed in childhood.&nbsp; Some of the more common 
tics include eye blinking and other vision irregularities, facial grimacing, 
shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking.&nbsp; Perhaps the most dramatic and 
disabling tics are those that result in self-harm such as punching oneself in 
the face, or vocal tics including coprolalia (uttering swear words) or echolalia 
(repeating the words or phrases of others).&nbsp; Many with TS experience additional 
neurobehavioral problems including inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, 
and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and 
repetitive behaviors. </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Because tic symptoms do not 
  often cause impairment, the majority of people with TS require no medication 
  for tic suppression. However, effective medications are available for those 
  whose symptoms interfere with functioning. There is no one medication that is 
  helpful to all people with TS, nor does any medication completely eliminate 
  symptoms.&nbsp; Effective medications are also available to treat some of the 
  associated neurobehavioral disorders that can occur in patients with TS.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Although TS can be a chronic 
  condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition 
  experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement 
  occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood.&nbsp; As a result, some 
  individuals may actually become symptom free or no longer need medication for 
  tic suppression.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The National Institute of 
  Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National 
  Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research in laboratories at the NIH and 
  also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions 
  across the country.&nbsp; Knowledge about TS comes from studies across a number of 
  medical and scientific disciplines, including genetics, neuroimaging, 
  neuropathology, clinical trials (medication and non-medication), epidemiology, 
  neurophysiology, neuroimmunology, and descriptive/diagnostic clinical 
  science.&nbsp; Findings from these studies will provide clues for more effective 
  therapies.</div>
