          In 1966, Ralph Baer designed a ping-pong game for his Odyssey gaming console. 
          Nolan Bushnell played this game at a Magnavox product show in Burlingame, 
          California. Bushnell hired young engineer Al Alcorn to design a car driving 
          game, but when it became apparent that this was too ambitious for the 
          time, he had Alcorn to design a version of ping-pong instead. The game 
          was tested in bars in Grass Valley and Sunnyvale, California where it 
          proved very popular. Pong would revolutionize the arcade industry and 
          launch the modern video game era.</span></td>

          and used a graphics tablet for drawing. It was designed by Richard Shoup
