<!-- INBODYEND -->A planet larger than <a href="pluto.htm">Pluto</a> has been discovered 
in the outlying regions of the solar system.
<p>The planet was discovered using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory 
near San Diego, Calif. The discovery was announced today by planetary scientist 
Dr. Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., whose 
research is partly funded by NASA. </p>
<p>The planet is a typical member of the <a href="Kuiper%20Belt.htm">Kuiper belt</a>, but 
its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified 
as a planet, Brown said. Currently about 97 times further from the sun than the 
Earth, the planet is the farthest-known object in the solar system, and the third 
brightest of the Kuiper belt objects. </p>

    in our solar system, called 2003UB313, were taken on Oct. 21, 2003, using the 
    Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, Calif. The 
    planet, circled in white, is seen moving across a field of stars. The three 
    images were taken about 90 minutes apart. Scientists did not discover that the 
    object in these pictures was a planet until Jan. 8, 2005. <i>(Image credit:

<p>&quot;It will be visible with a telescope over the next six months and is currently 
almost directly overhead in the early-morning eastern sky, in the constellation 
Cetus,&quot; said Brown, who made the discovery with colleagues Chad Trujillo, of the 
Gemini Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and David Rabinowitz, of Yale University, 
New Haven, Conn., on January 8. </p>
<p>Brown, Trujillo and Rabinowitz first photographed the new planet with the 48-inch 
Samuel Oschin Telescope on October 31, 2003. However, the object was so far away 
that its motion was not detected until they reanalyzed the data in January of this 
year. In the last seven months, the scientists have been studying the planet to 
better estimate its size and its motions. </p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s definitely bigger than <a href="pluto.htm">Pluto</a>,&quot; said Brown, who 
is a professor of planetary astronomy. </p>
<p>Scientists can infer the size of a solar system object by its brightness, just 
as one can infer the size of a faraway light bulb if one knows its wattage. The 
reflectance of the planet is not yet known. Scientists can not yet tell how much 
light from the sun is reflected away, but the amount of light the planet reflects 
puts a lower limit on its size. </p>
<p>&quot;Even if it reflected 100 percent of the light reaching it, it would still be 
as big as Pluto,&quot; says Brown. &quot;I&#39;d say it&#39;s probably one and a half times the size 
of Pluto, but we&#39;re not sure yet of the final size. </p>
<p>&quot;We are 100 percent confident that this is the first object bigger than Pluto 
ever found in the outer solar system,&quot; Brown added. </p>
<p>The size of the planet is limited by observations using NASA&#39;s Spitzer Space 
Telescope, which has already proved its mettle in studying the heat of dim, faint, 
faraway objects such as the Kuiper-belt bodies. Because Spitzer is unable to detect 
the new planet, the overall diameter must be less than 2,000 miles, said Brown.
</p>
<p>A name for the new planet has been proposed by the discoverers to the International 
Astronomical Union, and they are awaiting the decision of this body before announcing 
the name. </p>
