      <p>To specifically serve the teacher population, a publication entitled Guidelines 
      for Geographic Education was published in&nbsp; 1984 and its contents became

      <p>The five themes served as a framework upon which the content of geography 
      can be taught and served the K-12 population until the national geography 
      standards were published in 1994.&nbsp; Since the six elements of the national 
      standards embrace the five themes, they remain a valuable tool for students 
      to use in developing a &quot;geographic perspective,&quot; while the standards strengthen 
      instructional planning.</p>
      <p class="subheader">
      <a class="subheader" onclick="showhide('locationp'); return(false);" href="#" name="Location">
      Location</a></p>
      <p id="locationp" style="display: none">&quot;Where are we?&quot; is the question that 
      the theme <i>Location</i> answers. Location may be absolute or it may be relative. 
      These locations, whether relative or absolute, may be of people or places.<br>
      <br>
      An <u>absolute location</u> is a latitude and longitude (a global location) 
      or a street address (local location).<br>
      <br>
      Florence, AL is 34<sup>o</sup>46&#39; North latitude and 87<sup>o</sup>40&#39; West 
      longitude<br>
      Paris, France is 48<sup>o</sup>51&#39; North latitude and 2<sup>o</sup>20&#39; East 
      longitude<br>
      Marshall Islands are 10<sup>o</sup>00&#39; North latitude and 165<sup>o</sup>00&#39; 
      East longitude<br>
      <br>
      <u>Relative locations</u> are described by landmarks, time, direction or distance 
      from one place to another and may associate a particular place with another.</p>

      Place</a><br>
      </p>
      <p id="placep" style="display: none">What kind of place is it? What do you 
      think of when you imagine China? Japan? Russia? Saudi Arabia?<br>
      <br>
      Places have both <u>human</u> and <u>physical</u> characteristics, as well 
      as images.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Physical</u> characteristics include mountains, rivers, soil, beaches, 
      wildlife, soil. Places have <u>human</u> characteristics also. These characteristics 
      are derived from the ideas and actions of people that result in changes to 
      the environment, such as buildings, roads, clothing, and food habits.<br>
      <br>
      The image people have of a place is based on their experiences, both intellectual 
      and emotional.&nbsp; People&#39;s descriptions of a place reveal their values, 
      attitudes, and perceptions.<br>
      <br>
      How is your hometown connected to other places? What are the human and physical 
      characteristics of Florence? How do these shape our lives?</p>
      <p class="subheader">
      <a class="subheader" onclick="showhide('humanp'); return(false);" href="#" name="Human-Environmental Interactions">
      Human/Environmental Interactions</a><br>
      </p>
      <p id="humanp" style="display: none">How do humans and the environment affect 
      each other? We change the environment and then sometime Mother Nature changes 
      it back. For example, floods in the mid-West, Hurricane Emily (Hatteras), 
      and earthquakes and mudslides in California.<br>
      <br>
      There are three key concepts to human/environmental interaction:<br>
      <br>
      Humans adapt on the environment.<br>
      Humans modify the environment.<br>
      Humans depend to the environment.<br>
      <br>
      People depend on the Tennessee River for our water and transportation. People 
      modify our environment by heating and coolings buildings for comfort. People 
      adapt to the environment by wearing clothing that is suitable for summer and 
      winter; rain and shine.<br>
      <br>
      All places on Earth have advantages and disadvantages for human settlement. 
      One person&#39;s advantage may be another person&#39;s disadvantage. Some like the 
      excitement of large cities whereas others prefer remoteness.&nbsp; Environment 
      is not just trees, spotted owls, and rain forests.&nbsp; Environment is a 
      feeling. What is the environment of a big city? Boston? Los Angeles? Dallas?<br>
      <br>
      Given the choice, where would you live? Why? What is the environment? How 
      do people interact with the environment? How do the physical features affect 
      us?<br>
      <br>
      How have we adapted to or changed our landscape? For example, in the Sudan 
      even though everything is seemingly barren, the land sustains farmers and 
      nomadic herders. People and animals have adapted to a hot, dry climate.

      Movement</a></p>
      <p id="movementp" style="display: none">The movement of people, the import 
      and export of goods, and mass communication have all played major roles in 
      shaping our world.&nbsp; People everywhere interact. They travel from place 
      to place and they communicate. We live in a global village and global economy.<br>
      <br>
      People interact with each other through movement. Humans occupy places unevenly 
      on Earth because of the environment but also because we are social beings.&nbsp; 
      We interact with each other through travel, trade, information flows (E-Mail) 
      and political events.<br>
      <br>
      Not only do humans move but also ideas move; fashions move; fads move. What 
      is an example of an idea that moves? Fashion? Fad? How do we depend on people 
      in other places? How would our lives change if our movement options changed? 
      What would happen if we traveled by camel or horse? How do we move from place 
      to place? How do we actually get food?</p>
      <p class="subheader">
      <a class="subheader" onclick="showhide('regionsp'); return(false);" href="#" name="Regions">
      Regions</a></p>
      <p id="regionsp" style="display: none">A region is the basic unit of study 
      in geography. A region is an area that displays a coherent unity in terms 
      of the government, language, or possibly the landform or situation. Regions 
      are human constructs that can be mapped and analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      There are three basic types of regions. <br>
      <br>
      <u>Formal regions</u> are those defined by governmental or administrative 
      boundaries (i. e., United States, Birmingham, Brazil). These regional boundaries 
      are not open to dispute, therefore physical regions fall under this category 
      (i. e., The Rockies, the Great Lakes States).<br>
      <br>
      <u>Functional regions</u> are those defined by a function (i. e., TVA, United 
      Airlines Service area or a newspaper service area). If the function ceases 
      to exists, the region no longer exists.<br>
      <br>
      <u>Vernacular regions</u> are those loosely defined by people&#39;s perception 
      (i. e., The South, The Middle East).<br>
      <br>
      What region do we live in? What type of region is it? What are its characteristics? 
      South, North Alabama, the Shoals, the University community? What states do 
      you define as the South? The Northeast? The Bible Belt? What characteristics 
      and perceptions go along with these regions?</p>
