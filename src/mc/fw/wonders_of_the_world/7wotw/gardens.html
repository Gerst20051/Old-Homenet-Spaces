    <h3 align="center">The approach to the Garden sloped like a hillside and the 
    several parts of the structure rose from one another tier on tier... On all 
    this, the earth had been piled... and was thickly planted with trees of every 
    kind that, by their great size and other charm, gave pleasure to the beholder... 
    The water machines [raised] the water in great abundance from the river, although 
    no one outside could see it.</h3>

    <p>Fruits and flowers... Waterfalls... Gardens hanging from the palace terraces... 
    Exotic animals... This is the picture of the Hanging Gardens of
    <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/joseph_mccabe/religious_controversy/chapter_08.html#1">
    Babylon</a> in most people&#39;s minds. It may be surprising to know that they might 
    have never existed except in the minds of Greek poets and historians! </p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>On the east bank of the River Euphrates, about 50 km south of Baghdad,
    <a href="http://www.city.net/countries/iraq/">Iraq</a>. </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Babylonian kingdom flourished under the rule of the famous King,
    <a href="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/91/1">Hammurabi</a> (1792-1750 BC). 
    It was not until the reign of Naboplashar (625-605 BC) of the Neo-Babylonian 
    dynasty that the Mesopotamian civilization reached its ultimate glory. His son, 
    Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562 BC) is credited for building the legendary Hanging 
    Gardens. It is said that the Gardens were built by Nebuchadnezzar to please 
    his wife or concubine who had been &quot;brought up in Media and had a passion for 
    mountain surroundings&quot;. </p>
    <p>While the most descriptive accounts of the Gardens come from Greek historians 
    such as Berossus and Diodorus Siculus, Babylonian records stay silent on the 
    matter. Tablets from the time of Nebuchadnezzar do not have a single reference 
    to the Hanging Gardens, although descriptions of his palace, the city of Babylon, 
    and the walls are found. Even the historians who give detailed descriptions 
    of the Hanging Gardens never saw them. Modern historians argue that when
    <a href="http://www.wallop.demon.co.uk/alexander/index.htm">Alexander&#39;s</a> 
    soldiers reached the fertile land of
    <a href="http://www-oi.uchicago.edu/OI/DEPT/RA/ABZU/ABZU_REGINDX_MESO.HTML">
    Mesopotamia</a> and saw Babylon, they were impressed. When they later returned 
    to their rugged homeland, they had stories to tell about the amazing gardens 
    and palm trees at Mesopotamia.. About the palace of Nebuchadnezzar.. About the 
    Tower of Babel and the ziggurats. And it was the imagination of poets and ancient 
    historians that
    <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/gardens_bw2.jpg">blended 
    all these elements</a> together to produce one of the World Wonders. </p>
    <p>It wasn&#39;t until the twentieth century that some of the mysteries surrounding 
    the Hanging Gardens were revealed. Archaeologists are still struggling to gather 
    enough evidence before reaching the final conclusions about the location of 
    the Gardens, their irrigation system, and their true appearance. Some recent 
    researchers even suggest that the Hanging Gardens were built by Senaherib, not 
    by Nebuchadnezzar II (ca. 100 years earlier).</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Detailed descriptions of the Gardens come from ancient Greek sources, including 
    the writings of Strabo and Philo of Byzantium. Here are some excerpts from their 
    accounts: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The Garden is quadrangular, and each side is four plethra long. It consists 
      of arched vaults which are located on checkered cube-like foundations.. The 
      ascent of the uppermost terrace-roofs is made by a stairway...&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;The Hanging Garden has plants cultivated above ground level, and the roots 
      of the trees are embedded in an upper terrace rather than in the earth. The 
      whole mass is supported on stone columns... Streams of water emerging from 
      elevated sources flow down sloping channels... These waters irrigate the whole 
      garden saturating the roots of plants and keeping the whole area moist. Hence 
      the grass is permanently green and the leaves of trees grow firmly attached 
      to supple branches... This is a work of art of royal luxury and its most striking 
      feature is that the labor of cultivation is suspended above the heads of the 
      spectators&quot;. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>More recent archaeological excavations at the ancient city of Babylon in 
    Iraq uncovered the
    <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/gardens_site.jpg">foundation 
    of the palace</a>. Other findings include the Vaulted Building with thick walls 
    and an irrigation well near the southern palace. A group of archaeologists surveyed 
    the area of the southern palace and
    <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/gardens_bw1.jpg">reconstructed 
    the Vaulted Building</a> as the Hanging Gardens. However, the Greek historian 
    Strabo had stated that the gardens were situated by the River Euphrates. So 
    others argue that the site is too far from the Euphrates to support the theory 
    since the Vaulted Building is several hundreds of meters away. They reconstructed 
    the site of the palace and located the Gardens in the area stretching from the 
    River to the Palace. On the river banks, recently discovered massive walls 25 
    m thick may have been stepped to form terraces... the ones described in Greek 
    references. </p>
