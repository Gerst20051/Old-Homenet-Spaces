THURSDAY  JUNE 14.   IN CONVENTION [1]

Mr. PATTERSON, observed to the Convention that it was the wish of
several deputations, particularly that of N. Jersey, that further time
might be allowed them to contemplate the plan reported from the
Committee of the Whole, and to digest one purely federal, and
contradistinguished from the reported plan. He said they hoped to have
such an one ready by tomorrow to be laid before the Convention: And the
Convention adjourned that leisure might be given for the purpose.
