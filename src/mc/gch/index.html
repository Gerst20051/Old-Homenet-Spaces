      <p id="first" style="display: none">Although the first computer games appeared 
      in the 50s it was not until 1972 that Magnavox released the first home video 
      game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, designed by Ralph Baer. The Odyssey was 
      initially only moderately successful, and it was not until Atari&#39;s arcade 
      game PONG popularized video games several months later the public began to 
      take more notice of the emerging industry. By [1975] Magnavox, bowing to the 
      popularity of PONG, cancelled the Odyssey and released a scaled down console 
      that only played PONG - the Odyssey 100. Almost simultaneously released with 
      Atari&#39;s own home PONG console through Sears, these consoles jump started the 
      consumer market. As with the arcade market, the home market was soon flooded 
      by dedicated consoles that played simple pong and pong derived games.<br>

      Second Generation</a></p>
      <p id="second" style="display: none">Fairchild released the Fairchild Video 
      Entertainment System (VES) in 1976. While there had been previous game consoles 
      that used cartridges, either the cartridges had no information and served 
      the same function as flipping switches (the Odyssey) or the console itself 
      was empty and the cartridge contained all of the game components. The VES, 
      however, contained a programmable microprocessor so its cartridges only needed 
      a single ROM chip to store microprocessor instructions. RCA and Atari soon 
      released their own cartridge-based consoles.<br>
      <br>
      Video game crash of 1977<br>
      <br>
      In 1977, manufacturers of older obsolete consoles sold their systems at a 
      loss to clear stock, creating a glut in the market and causing Fairchild and 
      RCA to abandon their game consoles. Only Atari and Magnavox stayed in the 
      home console market.<br>
      <br>
      Rebirth of the home console market<br>
      <br>
      The VCS continued to be sold at a profit after the 1977 crash, and both Bally 
      (with their Home Library Computer in 1977) and Magnavox (with the Odyssey2 
      in 1978) brought their own programmable cartridge based consoles to the market. 
      However it wasn&#39;t until Atari released a conversion of the arcade hit Space 
      Invaders that the home console industry was completely revived. Many consumers 
      bought an Atari just for Space Invaders. Space Invaders&#39; unprecedented success 
      started the trend of console manufacturers trying to get exclusive rights 
      to arcade titles, and the trend of advertisements for game consoles claiming 
      to bring the arcade experience home.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the early 80&#39;s other companies released video game consoles of 
      their own. Many of the video game systems were technically superior to the 
      Atari 2600, and marketed as improvements over the Atari 2600. However, Atari 
      dominated the console market throughout the early 80&#39;s<br>
      <br>
      Video game crash of 1983<br>
      <br>
      In 1983, the video game business suffered a much more severe crash. A flood 
      of consoles, glut of low quality video games by smaller companies especially 
      for the 2600, industry leader Atari hyping games such as E.T. that were poorly 
      received, and a growing number of home computer users caused consumers and 
      retailers to lose faith and interest in video game consoles. Most video game 
      companies filed for bankruptcy, or moved into other industries, abandoning 
      their game consoles. Intellivision sold the rights of the Intellivision to 
      INTV Corp, who continued to produce Intellivision consoles and develop new 
      games for the Intellivision until 1991. All other North American game consoles 
      were discontinued by 1984.<br>

      In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom in Japan. It supported high-res, full 
      color, tiled backgrounds, and high-res sprites. This allowed Famicom games 
      to be longer, and have more detailed graphics. Nintendo brought their Famicom 
      over to the US in the form of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. In 
      the US, video games were seen as a fad that had already passed. To distinguish 
      its product from older video game consoles Nintendo used a front loading cartridge 
      port similar to a VCR on the NES, packaged the NES with a plastic &quot;robot&quot; 
      and a light gun, and originally advertised it as a toy. Nintendo also built 
      a lock-out chip into the NES. This kept third parties from producing their 
      own cartridges and forced all developers to go through Nintendo to get NES 
      games published. This allowed Nintendo to do things like prevent developers 
      from releasing low-quality games and limit developers to five titles a year. 
      Like Space Invaders for the 2600, Nintendo found its breakout hit game in 
      Super Mario Brothers. Nintendo&#39;s success revived the video game industry and 
      new consoles were soon introduced in the following years to compete with the 
      NES.<br>

      <p id="fourth" style="display: none">Sega&#39;s Master System was intended to 
      compete with NES, but never gained any significant market share and was barely 
      profitable. Sega regained market share by releasing their next-generation 
      console, The Sega Genesis, which was released in Japan on the 29th of October 
      1988, and in the USA/Europe on the 1st of September 1989 (under the new name 
      of Sega Mega Drive), two years before Nintendo could release the Super Nintendo 
      Entertainment System (SNES)(1990).<br>

      Vectorman (Genesis).<br>
      <br>
      The first fifth generation consoles were the Atari Jaguar and the 3DO. Both 
      of these systems were much more powerful than the SNES or Genesis (known as 
      Mega Drive outside the U.S.); they were better at rendering polygons, could 
      display more onscreen colors, and the 3DO used CDs that contained far more 
      information than cartridges and were cheaper to produce. Neither of these 
      consoles were serious threats to Sega or Nintendo, though. The 3DO cost more 
      than the SNES and Genesis combined, and the Jaguar was extremely difficult 
      to program for, leading to a lack of games that used its extra power.<br>
      <br>
      Nintendo released games like Donkey Kong Country that could display a wide 
      range of tones (something common in fifth-gen games) by limiting the number 
      of hues onscreen, and games like Star Fox that used an extra &quot;Super FX chip&quot; 
      inside of the cartridge to display polygon graphics. Sega followed suit, releasing 
      Vectorman and Virtua Racing (the latter of which used the Sega Virtua Processor.)<br>
      <br>
      It was not until Sony&#39;s PlayStation, Sega&#39;s Saturn, and Nintendo&#39;s Nintendo 
      64 were released that fifth generation consoles started to become popular. 
      They had advanced polygon capabilities. The Saturn and Playstation used CDs 
      to store games, while the N64 still used catridges. All three cost far less 
      than the 3DO, and were easier to program for than the Jaguar. The Saturn also 
      had 2D sprite handling power on par with the Neo-Geo.<br>
