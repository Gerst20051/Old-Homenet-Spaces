    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Parenting teens is often seen as one long battle. At 
    various stages throughout adolescence your teen is likely to challenge you on 
    one or all of the following: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">The boundaries you set for them </font></li>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">The expectations you have of them </font></li>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">The values and beliefs you give to them</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">This is both normal and healthy. And how you deal with 
    these challenges will often determine how difficult the teenage years will be.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">But some parents will have an altogether different 
    experience. They will have a teen who doesn&#39;t challenge them in any of these 
    ways. The difficulty for these parents is how to help a teen who may be anxious, 
    timid, or severely lacking in confidence. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7"><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div class="header2">
      <font color="#40AAB7">So what needs to change?</font></div>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Parenting a teen is all about preparing your teen for 
    adulthood. This means teaching them to think for themselves, to be accountable 
    for their actions and to cope with the emotional ups and downs of life.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">And the way in which most teens learn is by doing it 
    themselves. Unfortunately , because parents want to protect their teen, they 
    often fall into the trap of deciding what&#39;s best for their teen. Now is the 
    time to start letting go and let your teen stand - or fall - on their own two 
    feet.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">This doesn't mean abandoning your teen, far from 
    it. Parenting teens takes time and energy. You need to be able to communicate effectively 
    with your teen so that you can understand what&#39;s going 
    on for them.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Resist the urge to be &#39;the expert&#39; and encourage your 
    teen to think for themselves. Give them responsibility for both 
    themselves and their actions and be supportive when they get it wrong. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Above all, be kind to yourself. If you mess up don&#39;t 
    beat yourself up. Remember it&#39;s important for your teen to realize that you&#39;re 
    human too - something that teens often forget!.</font></p>
