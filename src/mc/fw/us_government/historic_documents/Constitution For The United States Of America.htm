which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers,

those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three 
fifths of all other Persons</i> [<a href="http://www.constitution.org/afterte_.htm#amd14.2">Modified

<p>Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, 
they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the 
Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, 
of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class 
at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second 
Year; <i>and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess 
of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments 
until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies</i>

that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United 
States <font SIZE="-2">is tried</font>, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no 
Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.</p>
<p>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from 
Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit 
under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and 
subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.</p>
<p><b><i>Section. 4.</i></b> The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for 
Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature 
thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, 
except as to the Places of choosing Senators.</p>
<p>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, <i>and such Meeting 
shall be on the first Monday in December</i> [<a href="http://www.constitution.org/afterte_.htm#amd20.2">Modified 
by Amendment XX</a>], unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.</p>
<p><b><i>Section. 5.</i></b> Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns

for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the 
United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the

House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as 
on other Bills.</p>

shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; 
If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections 
to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections 
at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration 
two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together 
with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, 
and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such 
Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names 
of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of 
each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within 
ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same 
shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their 
Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.</p>
<p>Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House 
of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall 
be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take 
Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be reposed

Electors should be appointed by the States which have ratified the same, and a Day 
on which the Electors should assemble to vote for the President, and the Time and 
Place for commencing Proceedings under this Constitution. That after such Publication 
the Electors should be appointed, and the Senators and Representatives elected: 
That the Electors should meet on the Day fixed for the Election of the President, 
and should transmit their Votes certified, signed, sealed and directed, as the Constitution 
requires, to the Secretary of the United States in Congress assembled, that the 
Senators and Representatives should convene at the Time and Place assigned; that 
the Senators should appoint a President of the Senate, for the sole purpose of receiving, 
opening and counting the Votes for President; and, that after he shall be chosen, 
the Congress, together with the President, should, without Delay, proceed to execute 
this Constitution.</p>
