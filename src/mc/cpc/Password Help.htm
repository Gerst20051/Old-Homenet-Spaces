<h2>Choosing Good Passwords</h2>
<p>It can be difficult to choose a good password: the password should be fairly 
long and shouldn&#39;t be guessable, but at the same time it should be easy to remember. 
If the password is difficult to remember, you will find that you need to write it 
down. It is not a good idea to write down passwords as someone else can find the 
paper you have written it on (or the file you have put it in) and digitally impersonate 
you.</p>
<p>Before talking about how to choose good passwords, here are a few reminders of 
good general password practices:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Never share your password.</b><br>
  Your account is assigned to you. You will be held responsible for the activities 
  of the account. Your password is like your signature; giving it to other people 
  is like giving them the authority to sign your name -- and implies that whatever 
  they do has your approval.<br>
  <br>
  We do see cases where people will use someone else&#39;s email account to send harassing 
  email. Don&#39;t let this happen to you. </li>
  <li><b>Never write down a password.</b><br>
  Passwords that are written down can be easily stolen. </li>
  <li><b>Change your password with some frequency.</b><br>
  The longer that you have used your password, the more likely it is that someone 
  else will manage to figure it out. Just how frequently you should change your 
  password depends on how frequently you use it and what you are protecting with 
  it. For example, you may wish to change a password used to give access to financial 
  information more frequently than one to give access to read the news on a web 
  page. </li>
  <li><b>Never store your password in a program.</b><br>
  Many email clients, web browsers, and web services will offer to store your password 
  for you so that you don&#39;t need to type it in each time you want to use it. This 
  is a bad idea -- it is generally trivial for people to recover your password from 
  inside one of these programs if they have access to your computer (and sometimes 
  even if they don&#39;t).<br>
  It is also possible for some computer viruses to recover your password from such 
  stores and email them to random people or post them publicly on the Internet. 
  Such viruses may even distribute the password before anti-virus software is able 
  to locate and remove the virus. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Methods for Choosing a Good, Memorable Password</h3>
<h4>General Advice</h4>
<p><em>Please note:</em> For technical reasons, some systems have a fairly short 
limit on the length of a password. This limit is often eight characters. While the 
examples below are often longer than eight characters, the concepts for selecting 
passwords work eight characters just as they do at ten, twenty, or two hundred.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>When choosing a password, avoid using <em>dictionary words</em>.</b><br>
  Dictionary words are any common words, names, dates, or number, including words 
  in foreign language words. One standard method that that is used frequently when 
  attackers attempt to guess passwords is a <em>brute force attack</em>. In a brute 
  force attack, the attacker basically tries possible passwords over and over again 
  until they manage to break into the account. Often they try dictionaries of commonly 
  used passwords. We have seen dictionaries in English, Finnish, German, Japanese, 
  Latin, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Norwegian, Swedish, Chinese, Yiddish, Dutch, 
  common jargon from Biology, Physics, Computers, common female names, common male 
  names, names from cartoons, movies, television, Shakespeare, religion, mythology 
  as well as common and famous place names. It wouldn&#39;t surprise us to see dictionaries 
  of Farsi or Akkadian words, either. <b>Avoid using words or names, regardless 
  of the language.</b> </li>
  <li><b>Don&#39;t use common misspellings of dictionary words (including replacing 
  &quot;l&quot; with &quot;1&quot; and the like).</b><br>
  Many of the dictionaries include both common misspellings and words with letters 
  replaced with similar looking numbers. </li>
  <li><b>Don&#39;t use the name of the computer or your account.</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Don&#39;t use sample passwords, such as the ones on this page.</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Use a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and punctuation 
  (that is, use multiple <em>character classes</em>).</b><br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Avoid using characters that don&#39;t appear on a standard US 101 key keyboard.</b><br>
  While some systems may allow you to use &quot;unprintables&quot;, an accented character, 
  u-umlaut or a Euro symbol, don&#39;t count on it working correctly. Characters that 
  aren&#39;t easily typable on a standard US 101 key keyboard may not work correctly 
  in all circumstances. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Specific Methods for Selecting Good Passwords</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Use letters from a phrase or song lyric.</b><br>
  Think up a phrase. For example, &quot;Marx&#39;s Communist Manifesto has 8196 words in 
  it!&quot;. Once you&#39;ve decided on the phrase, choose the first (or last, or the second, 
  or whatever) letter from each word. &quot;<b>M</b>arx<b>&#39;s</b> <b>C</b>ommunist <b>
  M</b>anifesto <b>h</b>as <b>8196</b> <b>w</b>ords <b>i</b>n <b>i</b>t<b>!</b>&quot;<br>
  You&#39;ll notice that in this example we&#39;ve decided to include all the punctuation. 
  This is to improve the quality of the password.<br>
  So, your password would be <b>M&#39;sCMh8196wii!</b>. It is a nice, long password 
  with a good mixture of character classes. </li>
  <li>Combine a few pronounceable &quot;nonsense&quot; words with punctuation.<br>
  For example <b>nuit+Pog=tWi</b>. Pronouncable nonsense words are easier to remember 
  than random characters. In our example we have combined together the nonsense 
  words in a way that is similar to a arithmetic formula which makes it easier to 
  remember. You may want to use other punctuation for similar reasons. Another example 
  might be <b>Fp@par()</b>. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Handling Large Numbers of Passwords</h4>
<p>In the modern Internet environment, people often find that almost every web site 
that they visit wants them to remember a password. In addition, most people have 
passwords to access one or more email accounts and to provide access to all sorts 
of different Internet-based services that they wish to use. At the same time, using 
the same password in multiple locations is very dangerous: if the password is stolen 
from any one of the places where it is used, it can be use elsewhere as well.
</p>
<p>Below are a few ideas on various ways to handle the increasing number of passwords 
that seem to be required these days while not making the passwords easy to guess.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Consider what the password is protecting when choosing a password.</b><br>
  Many passwords protect configuration settings rather than protecting access to 
  sensitive data and/or access to email or other network services. Use a single 
  password for all such services. If the password is not protecting access to any 
  personal or financial information or allows other people to impersonate you (for 
  example, by sending email as you), you probably don&#39;t need to keep it as secure.
  <em>If you are not sure, always use a different password than you use on any other 
  site.</em> </li>
  <li><b>Consider your password as multiple parts: a central core of the password 
  and a prefix and/or suffix which is specific to the service that is being protected.</b><br>
  For example, your core might be &quot;gPw4&quot;, from &quot;<b>g</b>eneric <b>P</b>ass<b>w</b>ord
  <b>4</b> (for)...&quot;<br>
  If this password is to be a password for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">
  New York Times</a> Web Site, you might choose to add &quot;NYt&quot; to the beginning of 
  the password and &quot;n&quot; (for &quot;news&quot;) to the end. This would make your password:
  <b>NYtgPw4n</b>. Your password for <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> might 
  be <b>eBgPw4A</b> (&quot;A&quot; for &quot;auctions&quot;). </li>
  <li><b>The passwords protecting your most sensitive information should always 
  be different than other passwords.</b><br>
  Choose a formula such as the ones described above for the passwords that are less 
  important and typed infrequently, but for the most important passwords choose 
  something that is in no way related to any other of your passwords. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> While receiving a new password or passwords you may wish to write 
down your password until that you have a chance to memorize the password or passwords. 
If you do this, you should take <em>extreme</em> care not to lose the paper you 
have written it on. You should destroy the paper (e.g. tear it to shreds) once you 
have learned the password or passwords. </p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This article on choosing good passwords is by Lionel 
  Cons of group CN/SW at CERN. It appeared in CERN Computer Newsletter 210. Mr. 
  Cons kindly allowed us to adapt it for SLAC users.</font> </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Introduction<br>
&nbsp;</dt>
  </dl>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A good password:</font> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">is not guessable by any program in a reasonable 
    time (less than one week)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">is easily remembered (so there is no need to 
    write it down)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">is private (it is used and known by one person 
    only)</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">is secret (it does not appear in clear text 
    in any file or program or on a piece of paper pinned to the terminal).</font>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Remark: even if you use very good passwords you 
  should change your passwords from time to time (at least twice a year).</font>
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Why you should choose good passwords<br>
&nbsp;</dt>
  </dl>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The use of a bad password may allow someone to 
  use your account and therefore to use, modify, corrupt or destroy any of your 
  files or any files that you are allowed to modify.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As many of the computers at SLAC are connected 
  together, the mis-use of one account on one computer may lead to problems for 
  several accounts on several machines, including big, expensive ones.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">As stated in the &#39;Computer Account Responsibilities&#39; 
  form (a set of rules agreed by every user of a SLAC computer requiring an account) 
  every user must take care of protecting his/her account and data. If you use a 
  bad password, you allow someone to use or mis-use SLAC facilities and you are 
  responsible for that. Furthermore, if someone using your account caused problems, 
  you will be accused of this and you&#39;ve got no means to prove that it was not you!</font>
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>How many passwords should you have? <br>
&nbsp;</dt>
  </dl>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You will probably hear conflicting advice on this 
  topic. On the one hand, having one good password that you can remember is a convenience, 
  helps keep you from the hassle of getting your passwords reset if you forget them, 
  and helps keep you from committing the security breach of writing your passwords 
  down. One the other hand, if someone does obtain your password, they have access 
  to all of your accounts on all systems. This is one of the primary ways that hackers 
  jump from system to system and site to site.</font> </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It also may not matter how hard your password is 
  to guess. Some of the primary methods used today to collect passwords are &#39;sniffers&#39; 
  on the ethernets or on the keyboards of computers that have been broken into. 
  If you log in from another site, or using a &quot;public&quot; machine at a conference, 
  or from home using an Internet Service Provider, you expose your password.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A good compromise is to have one password for each 
  security &#39;domain&#39; that you deal with. A security domain can be thought of as an 
  area that has distinct security requirements that should keep it separate from 
  other things that you do. For instance, if you have several accounts for general 
  use, email, etc. at SLAC, they could all use the same password. If you had another 
  account at SLAC that had administrator or super-user privileges on a machine, 
  then that is a separate domain and should have a different password. Accounts 
  at SLAC should have different passwords from accounts at other places. You especially 
  should not have the same password on an online service provider as you do on your 
  SLAC account. Passwords for web-based services and other Internet services are 
  generally not very secure and shouldn&#39;t be reused for your SLAC accounts.</font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you&#39;re unsure about the security requirements 
  of systems that you have access to, ask your system administrator whether there 
  are any guidelines, or possibly even some strict requirements, about password 
  selection and management that should apply to you.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
  <dl>
    <dt>How to choose a password that is not easily guessable<br>
&nbsp;</dt>
  </dl>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The programs that try to guess passwords (or the 
  attacker of a machine) do not try all existing passwords, they only try a large 
  number (10^9) of &quot;frequently used&quot; passwords. So if you stay out of this search 
  space you are reasonably safe; to do so you can follow the following guidelines:<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">First, here is what you should NOT do:</font>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Don&#39;t use your login name in any form (as-is, 
    reversed, capitalized, doubled, with a prefix, with a suffix, etc.).</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Don&#39;t use in any form your first or last name 
    and, more generally, any information easily obtained about you. This includes 
    license plate numbers, telephone numbers, social security numbers, the make 
    of your car, the name of the street you live on, the name of your spouse or 
    of your children, etc.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Don&#39;t use a word contained in any dictionary 
    of any language, spelling lists, or other lists of words (acronyms, sequences 
    of letters like &#39;abcdef&#39; or &#39;qwerty&#39;, place names, car names, cartoon heroes, 
    etc.).</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Don&#39;t use a password shorter than eight characters 
    or with only alphabetic characters or only digits.</font> </li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Then, here is what you should do:</font> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do use a password with mixed-case alphabetics, 
    digits, punctuation.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do use long passwords (with 8 or more characters).</font>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Important note: please remember that each operating 
  system imposes its own restrictions:</font> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">UNIX: you can use all printable characters, 
    case IS significant. The maximum length is 63 characters. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">VMS: you can use all printable characters, case 
    IS NOT significant and you can use long passwords (up to 32 characters).</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Windows: You can use all printable characters, 
    case is significant. You must use characters from 3 of the following 4 character 
    sets (lower case alpha, upper case alpha, numeric, special). Passwords can be 
    up to 14 characters in length. </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Remark: if you use mixed-case characters, do not 
  use the following methods:</font> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">all lowercase or all uppercase</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">only the first or the last character in uppercase</font>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">only vowels in uppercase</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">only consonants in uppercase.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Arial" size="2">what are now considered &quot;standard&quot; substitutions 
    to get around the rules such as 0 for o, 3 for e, 1 for i or l, 7 for t, etc.
    </font></li>

<h1>Choosing a Good Password</h1>
<hr>
<p>Your password is what tells the computer that you are who you say you are. Until 
we can do retina scans like in James Bond movies, the password is the best that 
we can do. But, because your password is like a key to your account, you need to 
safeguard it. Anyone who has your password can get into your account, and your files. 
Anyone who can guess your password has it. Anyone who has your password can pose 
as you. Therefore, you may be held responsible for someone else&#39;s actions, if they 
are able to get your password. You may not wish this to happen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tips on safeguarding your password</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b><em>First and foremost, NEVER give your password to anyone.</em></b> ``Anyone&#39;&#39; 
  means your coworkers, your spouse, your systems administrator. In the event of 
  an emergency, the sysadmin can change your password. Your sytems administrator 
  never has a need to know your personal password. If someone needs to get onto 
  our machines, and has a reason to be here, do not give them access to your account. 
  Speak to the systems staff about us setting up an account for them. We would be 
  very happy to give them one.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><em>Make your password something you can remember.</em></b> Do not write 
  it down. If you really, honestly forget your password, we can easily give you 
  a new one. We&#39;d rather set your password once a month because you forgot it than 
  have someone find it written down and gain unauthorized access to your account.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><em>Make your password difficult for others to guess.</em></b> This is 
  not as hard as it initially seems. See the section below on chosing a good password.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><em>DO NOT Change your password because of mail from someone claiming to 
  be your systems administrator, supposedly needing access to your files!!</em></b> 
  This is a popular scam in some circles. Remember, your systems administrator never 
  needs your password for any reason. If someone needs to ask you to change your 
  password so that they can gain entry to your account, they do not have reason 
  to be there.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We run sophisticated password crackers on the password files of our machines. 
If we guess your password, you will have to come see a staffer to have it changed. 
These are the same crackers that the bad guys have access to, so if you have a weak 
password, it&#39;s better if we find out about it first. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Not to Choose a Password</h2>
<p>Here are some of the types of passwords that will be picked up by our crackers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Words in the dictionary. </li>
  <li>Words in <em>any</em> dictionary. </li>
  <li>Your user name. </li>
  <li>Your real name. </li>
  <li>Your spouse&#39;s name. </li>
  <li>Anyone&#39;s name (crackers don&#39;t necessarily know that your aunt&#39;s middle name 
  is Agnes, but it&#39;s easy enough to get a list of 100,000 names and try each one).
  </li>
  <li>Any word in any ``cracking dictionary.&#39;&#39; There are lists of words that crackers 
  use to try to crack passwords: passwords that a lot of people use. Some of these 
  lists include:
  <p>Abbreviations, Asteroids, Biology, Cartoons, Character Patterns, Machine names, 
  famous names, female names, Bible, male names, Movies, Myths-legends, Number Patterns, 
  Short Phrases, Places, Science Fiction, Shakespeare, Songs, Sports, Surnames
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>Any of the above, with a single character before or after it (``8dinner&#39;&#39;, 
  ``happy1&#39;&#39;). </li>
  <li>Any of the above, capitalized (``cat&#39;&#39; --&gt; ``Cat&#39;&#39;) </li>
  <li>Any of the above, reversed (``cat&#39;&#39; --&gt; ``tac&#39;&#39;), doubled (``cat&#39;&#39; --&gt; ``catcat&#39;&#39;) 
  or mirrored (``cat&#39;&#39; --&gt; ``cattac&#39;&#39;). </li>
  <li>We used to tell people that taking a word and substituting some characters 
  (a 0 (zero) for an o, or a 1 for an l) made a good password. This is no longer 
  the case. New crackers have the capability to crack things like this, in certain 
  situations. </li>
  <li>Words like ``foobar&#39;&#39;, ``xyzzy&#39;&#39; and ``qwerty&#39;&#39; are still just plain words. 
  They are also popular passwords, and the crack programs look for them. Avoid them.
  </li>
  <li>Any of the sample passwords, good or bad, mentioned in this document. </li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Choose a Good Password</h2>
<p>I know that coming up with a good password can be difficult, so here are some 
guidelines to use. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a password that is at least six characters long. This should be long 
  enough to discourage a brute-force attack. Currently, the maximum password length 
  on many Unix systems is eight characters, but if you want to add a few more characters 
  to make it easier to remember, go ahead. Just bear in mind that anything after 
  the eighth character will be ignored (so ``abnormalbrain&#39;&#39; is the same as ``abnormal&#39;&#39;).
  </li>
  <li>In general, a good password will have a mix of lower- and upper-case characters, 
  numbers, and punctuation marks, and should be at least 6 characters long. Unfortunately, 
  passwords like this are often hard to remember and result in people writing them 
  down. Do not write your passwords down!
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><em>The license plate rule:</em> take a phrase and try to squeeze it into 
  eight characters, as if you wanted to put it on a vanity license plate. </li>
  <li>Some people like to pick several small words, separated by punctuation marks 
  of some kind. </li>
  <li>Put a punctuation mark in the middle of a word, e.g., ``vege%tarian&#39;&#39;.
  </li>
  <li>Use some unusual way of contracting a word. You don&#39;t have to use an apostrophe.
  <p>One of my favorite passwords was ``kEp*-h&amp;y&#39;&#39;: ``kEp&#39;&#39; --&gt; ``keep&#39;&#39;, ``*-&#39;&#39; 
  --&gt; ``laser&#39;&#39; (like those signs that you see outside of physics labs), and ``h&amp;y&#39;&#39; 
  --&gt; ``handy&#39;&#39;; ``Keep your laser handy!&#39;&#39; </p>
  </li>
  <li>You can use control characters. Just bear in mind that a lot of them have 
  special meanings. If you use ^D, ^H or ^U, for example, you might not be able 
  to log in again. </li>
  <li>Think of an uncommon phrase, and take the first, second or last letter of 
  each word. ``You can&#39;t always get what you want&#39;&#39; would yield ``ycagwyw&#39;&#39;. Throw 
  in a capital letter and a puntuation mark or a number or two, and you can end 
  up with ``yCag5wyw&#39;&#39;. </li>
  <li>Deliberately misspelling one or more words can make your password harder to 
  crack. </li>
  <li>Use several of the techniques above. </li>
  <li>Something that no one but you would ever think of. The best password is one 
  that is totally random to anyone else except you. It is difficult to tell you 
  how to come up with these, but people are able to do it. Use your imagination!</li>
</ul>

is to take a<br>
phrase or quote that you can remember.</p>
<p>A Unix system password should be at least 6 characters long and include at least 
one upper case letter (A-Z), digit (0-9) or punctuation character (such as . , or 
- ). Passwords will not be accepted in Unix if: they are less than 6 characters 
long match anything in your Unix account information, such as your login name or 
an item from your &quot;finger&quot; data entry are found in the system&#39;s spelling dictionary 
have more than 2 repeated characters; thus &quot;aaa&quot; would be rejected. Included in 
prohibited passwords are names of people and places or any password that has one 
or more illegal characters in it. A ^ before a character means that the Ctrl key 
is held at the same time as the specified character. Illegal characters include: 
^c, ^d, ^g, ^h (or Backspace), ^i (or Tab), ^j, ^m, ^o, ^r, ^s, ^q, ^y, ^z, ^\, 
^, Delete, @, and #. <br>
<br>
Note: Unix administrators randomly run a program called crack. The purpose of this 
program is to test all the user passwords to see if they are too easily guessed. 
If it finds a password that is too easy, the Unix account is automatically suspended 
until the user changes his password.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How to Choose a Good Password:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a short, simple phrase, six to eight words, that will be easy for you 
  to remember.<br>
  I like to eat green peas.</li>
  <li>If any of the words are homonyms for other letters or symbols, write them 
  with those symbols (e.g. are =r, you = u, two = 2)<br>
  I like 2 eat green peas.</li>
  <li>Now, make an acronym. Drop all but the first letter of each word.<br>
  Il2egp </li>
  <li>Capitalize arbitrarily, but with restraint, try to keep the password easy 
  to remember.<br>
  iL2eGp</li>
  <li>Add a punctuation mark or two to bring your password&#39;s length to seven or 
  eight characters.<br>
  iL2eGp! </li>
</ol>

<p><b>To help protect the security of your account, please remember the following:
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not write your password down. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Do not tell anyone your password. The administrator of a computer system NEVER 
  needs to know anyone else&#39;s password. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Do not use the same password elsewhere. If your password is somehow disclosed 
  at another site or ours, it would make it very easy for a cracker (not a saltine) 
  to cause damage at multiple sites. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Do not keep it in any files. <br>

    How hard is it to choose a good password? Most people believe that choosing 
    a good password is easy. After all, how is somebody going to guess my wife&#39;s 
    maiden name?
    <p>In reality, people usually choose poor passwords. In 1990 [<a href="http://www.klein.com/dvk/publications/">Klein 
    1990</a>] an attempt to crack a large password database revealed over three 
    hundred passwords in the first fifteen minutes! One fifth of all password were 
    obtained in the first week and approximately one quarter were cracked by the 
    end of the search. More than half of the cracked passwords were six characters 
    or less and some accounts didn&#39;t even have a password. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>An intruder only needs one password</b>! </p>
    <p>Choosing a good password is a trade off between something that is difficult 
    to guess versus something that is easy to remember. While <i>@G7x.m^l</i> is 
    probably a good password, nobody will remember it and it is certain to appear 
    as a sticky note attached to a terminal. Conversely, your first name is very 
    easy to remember, but it is also trivial to guess. </p>
    <h2>Some simple rules of thumb</h2>
    <p>Some simple guidelines that will help you choose better passwords are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A password should be a minimum of eight characters long. </li>
      <li>Try to include some form of punctuation or digit. </li>
      <li>Use mixed case passwords if possible. </li>
      <li>Choose a phrase or a combination of words, that make the password easier 
      to remember. </li>
      <li>Do not use a word that can be found in <i>any</i> dictionary (including 
      foreign language dictionaries). </li>
      <li>Do not use a keyboard pattern such as <i>qwertyui</i> or <i>oeuidhtn</i> 
      (look at a Dvorak keyboard). </li>
      <li>Do not repeat any character more than once in a row like <i>zzzzzzzz</i>.
      </li>
      <li>Do not use all punctuation, all digit or all alphabetic. </li>
      <li>Do not use things that can be easily determined such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Phone numbers. </li>
        <li>Car registration. </li>
        <li>Friends&#39; or relatives&#39; names. </li>
        <li>Your name or employment details. </li>
        <li>Any Date. </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Never</b> use your account name as its password. </li>
      <li>Use different passwords for each machine. </li>
      <li>Change the password regularly and do not reuse passwords. </li>
      <li>Do not append or prepend a digit or punctuation mark to a word. </li>
      <li>Do not reverse words. </li>
      <li>Do not replace letters with similar looking numbers. For instance, all 
      of the letters <i>i</i> should not be blindly replaced replaced by the digit
      <i>1</i>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cracking passwords</h2>
    <p>The principle behind password cracking is quite simple: take a large word 
    list, encrypt each word and check if the encrypted string matches the user&#39;s 
    password. Word lists that are used frequently include English and other language 
    dictionaries, common names, pet names, television and movie characters, character 
    patterns on keyboards (for example, <i>qwerty</i>) and jargon or slang terms.
    </p>
    <p>To allow for the case that the user has not chosen a word in your word list, 
    an intruder can and usually will apply a large number of simple rules to each 
    word in the word list and check if any of these encrypt to the user&#39;s passwords. 
    Typical rules include appending and prepending digits and other punctuation 
    characters to words, reversing words, capitalising words, converting words to 
    all upper or all lower case, substituting letters or digits for other letters 
    and naturally many combinations of these. Since computers are fast, applying 
    these rules and encrypting the resulting guess doesn&#39;t take much time and a 
    lot of guesses can be made in a very short time. </p>
    <p>In addition, a CD based database is supposed to have been produced that contains 
    every word in a large dictionary plus many rule based permutations of these 
    words encrypted in every possible manner. This reduces password cracking to 
    a simple (and fast) database lookup. </p>
    <h2>How long is a good password?</h2>
    <p>The simple answer to this is that in general the longer the password the 
    better. </p>
    <p>Assuming that you&#39;re using a reasonable selection of characters for your 
    password, say letters and numbers, then the following table presents the number 
    of passwords possible for the various choices of length. It also includes an 
    estimate of how much time would be required to crack the password using a brute 
    force attack. </p>
    <p>The <i>cracking time</i> field is derived from a report in September 1993, 
    that claimed the record for the speed of cracking passwords. The claim was that 
    6.4 million passwords per second could be tested. Given that computer speeds 
    are increasing continuously, the following times are almost certainly over estimates 
    of the actual time required. </p>

    <p>Having said that longer is better, it is important to note that many machines 
    artificially restrict the length of the password usually by silently truncating 
    what you enter to their maximum length. Since this length is often eight characters 
    under Unix, the rest of this article will assume that an eight character password

    <p>So clearly, the richer the character set being used, the harder it will be 
    to crack passwords. You should attempt to include as a minimum both upper and 
    lower case characters and if possible, you should also include some digits, 
    punctuation symbols and/or control codes in your password. </p>
    <h2>Examples of how to construct good passwords</h2>
    <p>So now that typical bad passwords have been discussed, how is a good password 
    constructed? Try combining two or more words together or taking the first (or 
    second or last) letter of each word in an easily remembered phrase. Then mangle 
    the result by adding capitals, digits and punctuation characters. As an extra 
    measure, control characters can also be introduced. </p>
    <h3>Some examples of using multiple words with punctuation</h3>
    <p>Here is a pair of good examples of using multiple words: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>gOt%L0st!</tt> - got lost! </li>
      <li><tt>heLP4me$ </tt>- help for me (money) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And here is a bad one: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>T0gether </tt>- to get her </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Some examples of using a phrase</h3>
    <p>Here are three good examples of using phrases: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>rsKf0myH </tt>- Raindrops keep falling on my head. </li>
      <li><tt>wru2rxy? </tt>- Who are you to ask why. </li>
      <li><tt>bWiIso3! </tt>- Beware the ides of March! </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And here is a bad one: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>Aaaaaaaa </tt>- Always assert an ambiguous axiom and argue aggressively.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a final note, all the sample passwords listed in this article are now 
    known, and should not be used by anyone.</p>
