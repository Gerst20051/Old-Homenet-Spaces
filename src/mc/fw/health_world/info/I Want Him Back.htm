    <p><font color="magenta" size="4">Well, are you really really sure? At this 
    point I should warn you that if HE dumped YOU then most likely he won&#39;t want 
    you back and you should head straight for the &#39;Heal Ur Broken Heart&#39; section 
    of the website at once.</font></p>
    <p><font color="magenta" size="4">If however you dumped him and then realized 
    you loved him, or whatever, read on. Try whichever of the following you like 
    to get him back:</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2" size="4"><strong>1) GROVEL</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="deeppink" size="4"><em><strong>If you dumped him then chances 
    are he&#39;ll be feeling pretty heartbroken himself. If you&#39;re lucky he&#39;ll jump 
    straight back into your arms, if not, you&#39;ve got some SERIOUS groveling to 
    do, girlfriend! Apologies from the bottom of your heart. Tell him you now realize 
    what a big mistake you made. </strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2" size="4"><strong>2) REMINISCE</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="deeppink" size="4"><em><strong>Once you&#39;re on speaking terms 
    again, reminisce on all the good times you had together. Talk to him about it. 
    Bring up all your special places in conversation with him. The instant you get 
    him to admit, &#39;Yeah, we had fun,&#39; come back with &#39;Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we 
    had another chance?&#39;</strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2" size="4"><strong>3) MAKE HIM JEALOUS</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="deeppink" size="4"><em><strong>Yes, spite breeds spite and I 
    wouldn't recommend it. But this is a good one to used if HE dumped YOU (and if 
    you DIDN'T take my advice and go to the Heal Ur Broken Heart section). Don&#39;t 
    go out with some poor boy you don&#39;t really like just to make your ex-boy jealous---that&#39;s 
    horrible. Instead, make him THINK you have a whole crowd of waiting, jostling 
    boys. Flirt with his friends. It might work, it does on a lot of boys, but I 
    really wouldn&#39;t recommend it. It&#39;s spiteful. However, if it works out the best 
    for you, do email me at the usual address and tell me about it!</strong></em></font></font></p>
