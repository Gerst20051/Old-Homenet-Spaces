    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Giving responsibility to your teen is essential if 
    they are to take charge of their adult lives. It is never an easy decision to 
    make and it is normal to think a teenager too young to do this or not ready 
    to do that. But consider the following questions:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">How soon will your teen be &#39;leaving home&#39;?
      </font></li>
      <li><font color="#40AAB7">What will your teen need to know by then? </font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Even if your teenager is not physically leaving home, 
    they will have finished school and will be entering a new environment. Whether 
    that environment is further education or work, they will need to be prepared 
    for that change and that preparation needs to start now.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Teens need to be given small doses of responsibility 
    as soon as possible. Most will ask for it, but others will run a mile before 
    accepting any form of responsibility. In either case, the same rules apply.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
    <div class="header2">
      <font color="#40AAB7">So what needs to change?</font></div>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Teens need to understand the consequences of their 
    actions and realize the implications on others. This means that when things 
    go wrong, as they undoubtedly will at some stage, they need to actually experience 
    these consequences.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Parents often come in and rescue their teen when things 
    go wrong and this is perfectly natural. No parent wants to see their teen suffer. 
    Unfortunately this is often the worst thing you can do. If your teen doesn’t 
    actually <b>experience the emotional as well as physical consequence</b>, the 
    memory will quickly fade.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Much better that parents</font>
    <font color="#40AAB7">support their teens through these situations. Ask the 
    teen how <b>they</b> are going to deal with the consequences and what help do
    <b>they</b> need. In this way the teen retains ownership of the problem and 
    the responsibility for solving it. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">Obviously we are not talking about life and death situations 
    here. But there will be times when you question whether your teen is ready for 
    the responsibility. In fact every time your teen does something for the first 
    time where they are out of your sight, you are likely to feel this. So have 
    a back up plan in place (a topped up mobile phone helps here) and then it is 
    a case of believing in your teen.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#40AAB7">And the more you understand your teen and the better 
    communication you have with them, the easier this will be.</font></p>
