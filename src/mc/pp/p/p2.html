    <b>THE MAN WITHOUT A DREAM<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </b>Shallow and cold as a stream a man without a dream<br>
    Sitting upon a pedestal better than the rest of all us dream weavers.<br>
    We plant the dreams of our tomorrows<br>
    And get chipped nails and soiled hands from our labors.<br>
    He stands on rich black dirt doesn&#39;t have to change his shirt.<br>
    Put his brain in place of his brawn and lived his whole life knowing<br>
    Right from wrong!<br>
    He saw the black and white never saw the gray in things.<br>
    Never had to give up or fight.<br>
    Worked hard but forgot how to play.<br>
    Bought a house and raised a family.<br>
    This man without a dream could only see yesterday<br>
    He couldn&#39;t see tomorrow.&nbsp; This man of power<br>
    Always wanting to control. He knew what it was like to possess<br>
    The material things but his life was empty.<br>
    He had no dreams<br>
    Shallow and cold like the stream running through him.<br>
    No compassion in his soul.<br>
    Where will you go when your stream runs dry?<br>
    Who will then wipe the tears from your eyes?<br>
    When will you search deep within your soul? <br>
    Tell me now where do the years go?<br>
    I see you as a lonely man with all your dignity.<br>
    Sometimes I see you reaching out to me.<br>
    But you are distant from me now.<br>
    And I have more fields to plow.<br>
    Perhaps you&#39;ll plant a seed or two.<br>
    And I&#39;ll even watch them grow for you.<br>
    But your heart has grown shallow as the stream runs through it.<br>
    And you untouchable now there on your pedestal<br>
    I bow to you with dignity.<br>
    But I wouldn&#39;t trade all the dreams in the world<br>
    No not give up a single one.<br>
    For fear my heart too will dry up.<br>
    And I might become just like you<br>
    The woman without dreams!</font></p>

    It floods me with frigid water<br>
    As I sit here to write.<br>
    Paddling my way through the waves of your rejection<br>
    That cuts deep into my bleeding heart.<br>
    I struggle to stay afloat upon these shore less words.<br>
    And listen in hopes to hear you calling out to me.<br>
    But I wait in vain for I hear no answer from thee.<br>
    And this silence now sounds like the beating of your heart. <br>
    Traveling alone through this tunnel of night&#39;s blackness.<br>
    No warmth from you to guide my way<br>
    No place to turn.&nbsp; No place to stay.<br>
    I keep afloat upon my inner tube of hope.<br>
    But your only answer is these cold silent words.<br>
    I cant stand the silence nothing can be worse.<br>
    Just a soft whisper a word or two.<br>
    Any message as long as it&#39;s from you.<br>
    You&#39;re killing me softly<br>
    As I struggle to stay afloat upon<br>
    These shore less words.</font></p>

    </b>Perhaps I am, a bit eccentric with the things that I do.<br>
    Compulsively collecting costume jewelry.<br>
    With my vintage jewelry sparkling everywhere like diamonds.<br>
    But the joy it brings to me, no pleasure can compare.<br>
    Fake jewels of colored rhinestones and gemstones to.<br>
    Glittering where they are displayed<br>
    On an old K-Mart rotating watch case,<br>
    That I picked up for fifty dollars. My husband says I collect junk.<br>
    But it&#39;s for the beholder to see. Each unique piece is a jewel to me.<br>
    Perhaps I should have been born in another place and time.<br>
    There&#39;s a Victorian lady living inside of me.<br>
    Adorning her jewels displaying them proudly.<br>
    Each piece when found is part of the journey.<br>
    Each one has it&#39;s own history. A life existed that owned them before.<br>
    Who knows what secrets these jewels store!<br>
    Muli colors of the rainbow, yes I own them all.<br>
    Some blue, some pink, some green, some white and shimmering.<br>
    Era descent, black and purple containing stones of mystery,<br>
    It&#39;s the thrill of the hunt, the journey that makes it all worth it to me.<br>
    Yes, perhaps I am a bit eccentric. That&#39;s for you to decide.<br>
    But I&#39;ll go on collecting and display them with pride.<br>

    <br>
    <b>MY BIRTHDAY GIFT<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </b>I awoke with the normal morning routine of sloppy dog kisses and the sun 
    shining<br>
    Through my window, then there came such a clatter, <br>
    I had to jump up to see what the heck was the matter. There as bold as <br>
    Could be was a fat, brown squirrel staring at me, eating the bird feed I put 
    out. <br>
    Was he ever a sight for my sore eyes! <br>
    Cause I hadn&#39;t seen him in one long cold winters month!<br>
    I had given up hope and thought him dead along the roadside.<br>
    How I had missed watching him sit boldly and eat corn and sunflower seeds.<br>
    With his tiny feet and hands. <br>
    While my dogs would bark and jump up and down excitedly at my French door
    <br>
    where they could see out. That&#39;s how I knew it was my squirrel that returned 
    to <br>
    me.<br>
    He wasn&#39;t bothered by those dogs no way -no how -no soiree! <br>
    And I thought what a wonderful birthday gift my squirrel visiting me.<br>
    And letting me know he is okay after all. Knowing this was the most precious 
    gift <br>
    of all.<br>
    To know he is alive and well. It has put a warm glow upon my face.<br>
    And a song in my heart and a lesson learnt to never give up hope.<br>
    Nature has a way of taking care of it&#39;s own.<br>
    I can only await his return when once again he puts a smile on my face<br>
    And brightens up my world with his squirrelly self.<br>

    Another lost child in a woods full of tall dark oak trees. Asking for their

    Asking does anybody love me? Does anybody care?<br>
    For crying out loud is there anyone out there!<br>
    How can you give to one child and not all the rest?<br>
    How can you claim to be a good family man and leave those behind?<br>
    You know the one&#39;s hiding in the shadows created in another time.<br>
    The one&#39;s you all deny and say but they aren&#39;t mine!<br>
    Who&#39;s then are they? To whom do they belong?<br>
    Being raised with only a mom. Ignored by a whole family. <br>
    Not knowing their family tree. Longing to know from where they come.<br>
    Not asking much really in return. Just an open door to walk within<br>
    A place at the table to sit and talk, a man to call father and ask about their 
    day<br>
    What kind of man are you to turn away? What are you so afraid of anyways?<br>
    Afraid to face your own past I see. Afraid to look into the mirror and see who 
    is <br>
    staring<br>
    Back at you! Afraid to do what is right aren&#39;t you? It is your reality that 
    you fear.<br>
    You cannot change the past! But the future you can steer.<br>
    Don&#39;t look the other way like you&#39;ve done before. You will be the one to answer
    <br>
    in the end. Would you risk it all and just turn away again? Or will you be who
    <br>
    you are, a Father this day!! <br>
    To that little lost child that was forgotten along the way?<br>
    Can you hear her cry in the middle of the night? Do you toss and turn and yet
    <br>
    have no regret? I can hear her sweet crying in the breeze this night.<br>
    She&#39;s calling out to you and praying you&#39;ll make things right.<br>
    Oh, how can you stand to hear her crying in the breeze, it&#39;s such a sad picture,
    <br>
    sobbing<br>
    On her knees, for God&#39;s sake doesn&#39;t anyone else hear her but me? Will <br>
    someone please<br>
    Set this childfree? Give her back her identity!! Be a father to all your kids!!<br>
    Don&#39;t pick and choose because of your life or wife! <br>
    Be a man and take some responsibility! Love this child unconditionally!!<br>
    And for God&#39;s sake do it for you as much as for her.<br>
    Touch your soul and humanity. Don&#39;t let this child go for another day!<br>
    Take the time to show you care. Say you love them and then be there!!<br>
    So sad to listen to the children cry in the night so many have already given 
    up their<br>
    Fight. <br>
    It&#39;s just not right.<br>
    All these children crying in the night!<br>

    A sign of the coming rainbow, please take heed.<br>
    Journey back with me now in time<br>
    Remember when you were mine?<br>
    <br>
    And the presence of each other made us smile with content<br>
    We never knew where the time ever went.<br>
    But we had time back then to enjoy the simple things.<br>
    Like swinging on the park swings.<br>
    <br>
    Walking hand in hand. A woman and her man!<br>
    Funny how I never realized back then<br>
    Your smile would be worth its weight in gold!<br>
