<P><B>Many of you are here only because penicillin saved your life, or the life 
of one of your parents or grandparents. Penicillin's ability to cure people of 
many once-fatal bacterial infections has saved so many lives that it is easy to 
understand why it was once called a "miracle drug". </B></P>
<P><B>Antibiotics are chemicals, effective at very low concentrations, created 
as part of the life process of one organism, which can kill or stop the growth 
of a disease-causing microbe--a germ. In 1929, Alexander Fleming, a doctor and 
researcher at St. Mary's Hospital in London, England, published a paper on a 
chemical he called "penicillin", which he had isolated from from a mold, 
<I>Penicillium notatum</I>. Penicillin, Fleming wrote, had prevented the growth 
of a neighboring colony of germs in the same petri dish. Dr. Fleming was never 
able to purify his samples of penicillin, but he became the first person to 
publish the news of its germ-killing power. Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and 
Norman Heatley expanded on Fleming's work in 1938, at Oxford University. They 
and their staff developed methods for growing, extracting and purifying enough 
penicillin to prove its value as a drug.</B></P>
<P><B>World War II (1939-1945) had begun by the time their research was showing 
results. The main research and production was moved to the United States in 
1941, to protect it from the bombs pounding England. Work began on how to grow 
the mold efficiently to make penicillin in the large quantities that would be 
needed for thousands of soldiers. As the destruction of the war grew, so did 
interest in penicillin in laboratories, universities and drug companies on both 
sides of the Atlantic. The scientists knew they were in a race against death, 
because an infection was as likely to kill a wounded soldier as his 
wound.</B></P>

<P><B>Creating the right environment for growth was the first step in producing 
enough penicillin to be used as a drug. In Oxford, experiments showed that 
<I>Penicillium notatum</I> grew best in small shallow containers on a broth of 
nutrients. <I>Penicillium</I> need lots of air. In the United States, it was 
discovered that huge "deep fermentation" tanks could be used if sterilized air 
was pumped continually through the tanks. Production increased even more when 
corn steep liquor, a thick, sticky by-product of corn processing, was added to 
the tanks. Corn steep liquor contained concentrated nutrients that increased the 
yield 12-20 times. Formerly considered a waste material, corn steep liquor 
became a crucial ingredient in the large-scale production of penicillin.</B></P>
<P><B>Scientists were also determined to find another strain of 
<I>Penicillium</I> that might grow better in the huge deep fermentation tanks. 
Army pilots sent back soil samples from all over the world to be tested for 
molds. Residents of Peoria, Illinois, were encouraged to bring moldy household 
objects to the local U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where penicillin 
research was being conducted. Laboratory staff members also kept an eye out for 
promising molds while grocery shopping or cleaning out their refrigerators.

<P><B>In 1943, laboratory worker Mary Hunt brought in an ordinary supermarket 
cantaloupe infected with a mold that had "a pretty, golden look." This 
<I>Penicillium</I> species, <I>Penicillium chrysogenum</I> grew so well in a 
tank that it more than doubled the amount of penicillin produced. The deep 
fermentation method, the use of corn steep liquor and the discovery of <I>P. 
chrysogenum</I>by Mary Hunt made the commercial production of penicillin 
possible. Researchers continued to find higher-yielding <I>Penicillium</I> 
molds, and also produced higher yielding strains by exposing molds to x-rays or 
ultraviolet light.</B></P>
<P><B>Penicillin kills by preventing some bacteria from forming new cell walls. 
One by one, the bacteria die because they cannot complete the process of 
division that produces two new "daughter" bacteria from a single "parent" 
bacterium. The new cell wall that needs to be made to separate the "daughters" 
is never formed. </B></P>
<P><B>Some bacteria are able to resist the action of antibiotic drugs, including 
penicillin. Antibiotic resistance occurs because not all bacteria of the same 
species are alike, just as people in your own family are not exactly alike. 
Eventually, the small differences among the bacteria often mean that some will 
be able to resist the attack of an antibiotic. If the sick person's own defenses 
can not kill off these resistant bacteria, they will multiply. This 
antibiotic-resistant form of a disease can re-infect the patient, or be passed 
on to another person.</B></P>
<P><B>Taking antibiotics for viral illnesses like colds can also cause 
antibiotic resistant bacteria to develop. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses, 
but it will kill off harmless and even the beneficial bacteria living in the 
patient's body. The surviving resistant bacteria, free from competition, will 
live and multiply and may eventually cause disease.</B></P>
<P><B>Patients with bacterial infections, who don't finish their antibiotic 
prescriptions completely, also allow resistant bacteria to develop. This happens 
because a small number of semi-resistant bacteria, which needed the full course 
of antibiotics to kill them, survive. Instead of being a small part of the 
bacteria causing an infection, the more resistant bacteria take over when 
sensitive bacteria are killed by the antibiotic.</B></P>
<P><B>Today, in the United States, deaths by infectious bacterial diseases are 
only <I>one-twentieth</I> of what they were in 1900, before any antibiotic 
chemicals had been discovered. The main causes of death today are what are 
referred to as "the diseases of old age": heart disease, kidney disease and 
cancer. We would be shocked to hear of someone dying from an infection that 
started in a scratch, but, before antibiotics like penicillin, it was common for 
people to die from such infections.</B></P>
<P><B>Humans can slow the creation of antibiotic resistant diseases by 
understanding the uses and limits of antibiotics. Take all of an antibiotic, and 
only take them when prescribed by a doctor. Research to develop new antibiotics 
to treat resistant bacteria continues, but research takes time. Time is running 
out because the world's biodiversity is decreasing--the source of half of our 
disease-fighting chemicals. </B></P>
<P><B>An example of the importance of preserving the world's biodiversity 
occurred in 1996, in New York state. Students at Cornell University collected a 
fungus that finally made it possible to identify the two very different life 
stages of the mold that produces the drug cyclosporin. Cyclosporin prevents the 
rejection of transplanted organs. Without it, transplant operations would be 
impossible. Knowing the full life history of the cyclosporin-producing fungus 
may make it easier to find related molds. Even people who see no special beauty 
or value in the world's biodiversity may one day benefit from the currently 
unknown and powerful substances, produced by fungi and other microbes, that are 
waiting for discovery in familiar places. </B></P>
