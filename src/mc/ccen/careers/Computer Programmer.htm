<p>Computer programmers write, test, and maintain the detailed instructions, called 
programs, that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also 
conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. 
Many technical innovations in programming—advanced computing technologies and sophisticated 
new languages and programming tools—have redefined the role of a programmer and 
elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may 
vary, depending on the organization. In this occupational statement, <i>computer 
programmers</i> are individuals whose main job function is programming; this group 
has a wide range of responsibilities and educational backgrounds.</p>
<p>Computer programs tell the computer what to do—which information to identify 
and access, how to process it, and what equipment to use. Programs vary widely depending 
on the type of information to be accessed or generated. For example, the instructions 
involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to 
duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Although 
simple programs can be written in a few hours, programs that use complex mathematical 
formulas whose solutions can only be approximated or that draw data from many existing 
systems may require more than a year of work. In most cases, several programmers 
work together as a team under a senior programmer’s supervision.</p>
<p>Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily 
by computer software engineers and systems analysts. (Separate statements on
<a href="Computer%20Systems%20Analyst.htm">computer systems analysts</a> appear 
elsewhere in the <i>Handbook</i>.) After the design process is complete, it is the 
job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions 
that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in a conventional 
programming language such as COBOL; an artificial intelligence language such as 
Prolog; or one of the most advanced object-oriented languages, such as Java, C++, 
or ACTOR. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the 
program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business applications, whereas 
Fortran (short for “formula translation”) is used in science and engineering. C++ 
is widely used for both scientific and business applications. Extensible Markup 
Language (XML) has become a popular programming tool for Web programmers, along 
with J2EE (Java 2 Platform). Programmers generally know more than one programming 
language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages 
relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language 
they know, such as Java programmers, or by the type of function they perform or 
environment in which they work—for example, database programmers, mainframe programmers, 
or Web programmers.</p>
<p>Many programmers update, repair, modify, and expand existing programs. When making 
changes to a section of code, called a routine, programmers need to make other users 
aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments 
in the coded instructions so that others can understand the program. Many programmers 
use computer-assisted software engineering (CASE) tools to automate much of the 
coding process. These tools enable a programmer to concentrate on writing the unique 
parts of the program, because the tools automate various pieces of the program being 
built. CASE tools generate whole sections of code automatically, rather than line 
by line. Programmers also use libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized 
for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs 
and increases programmers’ productivity by eliminating some routine steps.</p>
<p>Programmers test a program by running it to ensure that the instructions are 
correct and that the program produces the desired outcome. If errors do occur, the 
programmer must make the appropriate change and recheck the program until it produces 
the correct results. This process is called testing and debugging. Programmers may 
continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Programmers working 
in a mainframe environment, which involves a large centralized computer, may prepare 
instructions for a computer operator who will run the program. (A separate statement 
on computer operators appears elsewhere in the <i>Handbook</i>.) Programmers also 
may contribute to a manual for persons who will be using the program.</p>
<p>Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types—applications programmers 
and systems programmers. <i>Applications programmers</i> write programs to handle 
a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They 
also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which 
are frequently purchased from vendors. <i>Systems programmers</i>, in contrast, 
write programs to maintain and control computer systems software, such as operating 
systems, networked systems, and database systems. These workers make changes in 
the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and central processing 
unit of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate 
with peripheral equipment such as terminals, printers, and disk drives. Because 
of their knowledge of the entire computer system, systems programmers often help 
applications programmers determine the source of problems that may occur with their 
programs.</p>
<p>Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts 
from various fields to create software—either programs designed for specific clients 
or packaged software for general use—ranging from games and educational software 
to programs for desktop publishing and financial planning. Programming of packaged 
software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services 
industry.</p>
<p>In some organizations, particularly small ones, workers commonly known as <i>
programmer-analysts</i> are responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual 
programming work. (A more detailed description of the work of programmer-analysts 
is presented in the statement on <a href="Computer%20Systems%20Analyst.htm">computer 
systems analysts</a> elsewhere in the <i>Handbook.</i>) Advanced programming languages 
and new object-oriented programming capabilities are increasing the efficiency and 
productivity of both programmers and users. The transition from a mainframe environment 
to one that is based primarily on personal computers (PCs) has blurred the once 
rigid distinction between the programmer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users 
are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by programmers. For example, 
the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management 
software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform 
calculations.</p>

<!-- Working Conditions Content -->
<p>Programmers generally work in offices in comfortable surroundings. Many programmers 
may work long hours or weekends to meet deadlines or fix critical problems that 
occur during off hours. Telecommuting is becoming common for a wide range of computer 
professionals, including computer programmers. As computer networks expand, more 
programmers are able to make corrections or fix problems remotely using modems, 
e-mail, and the Internet to connect to a customer’s computer.</p>
<p>Like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing 
at a keyboard, programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand 
and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>

<!-- Training Content -->
<p>Although there are many training paths available for programmers, mainly because 
employers’ needs are so varied, the level of education and experience employers 
seek has been rising due to the growing number of qualified applicants and the specialization 
involved with most programming tasks. Bachelor’s degrees are commonly required, 
although some programmers may qualify for certain jobs with 2-year degrees or certificates. 
The associate degree is a widely used entry-level credential for prospective computer 
programmers. Most community colleges and many independent technical institutes and 
proprietary schools offer an associate degree in computer science or a related information 
technology field.</p>
<p>Employers primarily are interested in programming knowledge, and computer programmers 
can become certified in a programming language such as C++ or Java. College graduates 
who are interested in changing careers or developing an area of expertise also may 
return to a 2-year community college or technical school for additional training. 
In the absence of a degree, substantial specialized experience or expertise may 
be needed. Even when hiring programmers with a degree, employers appear to place 
more emphasis on previous experience.</p>
<p>Some computer programmers hold a college degree in computer science, mathematics, 
or information systems, whereas others have taken special courses in computer programming 
to supplement their degree in a field such as accounting, inventory control, or 
another area of business. As the level of education and training required by employers 
continues to rise, the proportion of programmers with a college degree should increase 
in the future. As indicated by the following tabulation, more than two-thirds of 
computer programmers had a bachelor’s or higher degree in 2004.</p>

<p>Required skills vary from job to job, but the demand for various skills generally 
is driven by changes in technology. Employers using computers for scientific or 
engineering applications usually prefer college graduates who have degrees in computer 
or information science, mathematics, engineering, or the physical sciences. Graduate 
degrees in related fields are required for some jobs. Employers who use computers 
for business applications prefer to hire people who have had college courses in 
management information systems and business and who possess strong programming skills. 
Although knowledge of traditional languages still is important, employers are placing 
increasing emphasis on newer, object-oriented programming languages and tools such 
as C++ and Java. Additionally, employers are seeking persons familiar with fourth-generation 
and fifth-generation languages that involve graphic user interface and systems programming. 
Employers also prefer applicants who have general business skills and experience 
related to the operations of the firm. Students can improve their employment prospects 
by participating in a college work-study program or by undertaking an internship.</p>
<p>Most systems programmers hold a 4-year degree in computer science. Extensive 
knowledge of a variety of operating systems is essential for such workers. This 
includes being able to configure an operating system to work with different types 
of hardware and having the skills needed to adapt the operating system to best meet 
the needs of a particular organization. Systems programmers also must be able to 
work with database systems, such as DB2, Oracle, or Sybase.</p>
<p>When hiring programmers, employers look for people with the necessary programming 
skills who can think logically and pay close attention to detail. The job calls 
for patience, persistence, and the ability to work on exacting analytical work, 
especially under pressure. Ingenuity and creativity are particularly important when 
programmers design solutions and test their work for potential failures. The ability 
to work with abstract concepts and to do technical analysis is especially important 
for systems programmers because they work with the software that controls the computer’s 
operation. Because programmers are expected to work in teams and interact directly 
with users, employers want programmers who are able to communicate with nontechnical 
personnel.</p>
<p>Entry-level or junior programmers may work alone on simple assignments after 
some initial instruction, or they may be assigned to work on a team with more experienced 
programmers. Either way, beginning programmers generally must work under close supervision. 
Because technology changes so rapidly, programmers must continuously update their 
knowledge and skills by taking courses sponsored by their employer or by software 
vendors, or offered through local community colleges and universities.</p>
<p>For skilled workers who keep up to date with the latest technology, the prospects 
for advancement are good. In large organizations, programmers may be promoted to 
lead programmer and be given supervisory responsibilities. Some applications programmers 
may move into systems programming after they gain experience and take courses in 
systems software. With general business experience, programmers may become programmer-analysts 
or systems analysts or be promoted to managerial positions. Other programmers, with 
specialized knowledge and experience with a language or operating system, may work 
in research and development for multimedia or Internet technology and may even become 
computer software engineers. As employers increasingly contract with outside firms 
to do programming jobs, more opportunities should arise for experienced programmers 
with expertise in a specific area to work as consultants.</p>
<p>Certification is a way to demonstrate a level of competence, and may provide 
a jobseeker with a competitive advantage. In addition to language-specific certificates 
that a programmer can obtain, product vendors or software firms also offer certification 
and may require professionals who work with their products to be certified. Voluntary 
certification also is available through various other organizations.</p>

<!-- Employment Content -->
<p>Computer programmers held about 455,000 jobs in 2004. Programmers are employed 
in almost every industry, but the largest concentration is in computer systems design 
and related services. Large numbers of programmers also work for telecommunications 
companies, software publishers, financial institutions, insurance carriers, educational 
institutions, and government agencies.</p>
<p>Many computer programmers are employed on a temporary or contract basis or work 
as independent consultants, providing companies expertise with new programming languages 
or specialized areas of application. Rather than hiring programmers as permanent 
employees and then laying them off after a job is completed, employers can contract 
with temporary help agencies, with consulting firms, or with programmers themselves. 
A marketing firm, for example, may require programming services only to write and 
debug the software necessary to get a new customer database running. Bringing in 
an independent contractor or consultant with experience in a new or advanced programming 
language enables the firm to complete the job without having to retrain existing 
workers. Such jobs may last anywhere from several weeks to a year or longer. There 
were 25,000 self-employed computer programmers in 2004.</p>

<!-- Job Outlook Content -->
<p>As programming tasks become increasingly sophisticated and additional levels 
of skill and experience are demanded by employers, graduates of 2-year programs 
and people with less than a 2-year degree or its equivalent in work experience will 
face strong competition for programming jobs. Competition for entry-level positions, 
however, also can affect applicants with a bachelor’s degree. Prospects should be 
best for college graduates with knowledge of, and experience working with, a variety 
of programming languages and tools—including C++ and other object-oriented languages 
such as Java, as well as newer, domain-specific languages that apply to computer 
networking, database management, and Internet application development. Obtaining 
vendor-specific or language-specific certification also can provide a competitive 
edge. Because demand fluctuates with employers’ needs, jobseekers should keep up 
to date with the latest skills and technologies. Individuals who want to become 
programmers can enhance their prospects by combining the appropriate formal training 
with practical work experience.</p>
<p>Employment of programmers is expected to grow more slowly than the average for 
all occupations through the year 2014. Sophisticated computer software now has the 
capability to write basic code, eliminating the need for many programmers to do 
this routine work. The consolidation and centralization of systems and applications, 
developments in packaged software, advances in programming languages and tools, 
and the growing ability of users to design, write, and implement more of their own 
programs mean that more of the programming functions can be transferred from programmers 
to other types of information workers, such as computer software engineers.</p>
<p>Another factor limiting growth in employment is the outsourcing of these jobs 
to other countries. Computer programmers can perform their job function from anywhere 
in the world and can digitally transmit their programs to any location via e-mail. 
Programmers are at a much higher risk of having their jobs outsourced abroad than 
are workers involved in more complex and sophisticated information technology functions, 
such as software engineering, because computer programming has become an international 
language, requiring little localized or specialized knowledge. Additionally, the 
work of computer programmers can be routinized, once knowledge of a particular programming 
language is mastered.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, employers will continue to need programmers who have strong technical 
skills and who understand an employer’s business and its programming requirements. 
This means that programmers will have to keep abreast of changing programming languages 
and techniques. Given the importance of networking and the expansion of client/server, 
Web-based, and wireless environments, organizations will look for programmers who 
can support data communications and help implement electronic commerce and intranet 
strategies. Demand for programmers with strong object-oriented programming capabilities 
and technical specialization in areas such as client/server programming, wireless 
applications, multimedia technology, and graphic user interface likely will stem 
from the expansion of intranets, extranets, and Internet applications. Programmers 
also will be needed to create and maintain expert systems and embed these technologies 
in more products. Finally, a growing emphasis on cyber security will lead to increased 
demand for programmers who are familiar with digital security issues and skilled 
in using appropriate security technology.</p>
<p>Jobs for both systems and applications programmers should be most plentiful in 
data-processing service firms, software houses, and computer consulting businesses. 
These types of establishments are part of computer systems design and related services 
and software publishers, which are projected to be among the fastest growing industries 
in the economy over the 2004-14 period. As organizations attempt to control costs 
and keep up with changing technology, they will need programmers to assist in conversions 
to new computer languages and systems. In addition, numerous job openings will result 
from the need to replace programmers who leave the labor force or transfer to other 
occupations such as manager or systems analyst.</p>
