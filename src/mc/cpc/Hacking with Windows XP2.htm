Not many computers are reachable over the Internet using NetBIOS commands - maybe 
only a few million. But what the heck, a few million is enough to keep a hacker 
from getting bored. And if you know what to look for, you will discover that there 
are a lot of very busy hackers and Internet worms searching for computers they can 
break into by using NetBIOS commands. By learning the dangers of NetBIOS, you can 
get an appreciation for why it is a really, truly BAD!!! idea to use it.<br>
<br>
*****************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: a worm is a program that reproduces itself.&nbsp; For example, 
Code Red automatically searched over the Internet for vulnerable Windows computers 
and broke into them. So if you see an attempt to break into your computer, it may 
be either a human or a worm.<br>
*****************<br>
<br>
If you run an intrusion detection system (IDS) on your computer, you are certain 
to get a lot of alerts of NetBIOS attacks. Here&#39;s an example:<br>
<br>
The firewall has blocked Internet access to your computer (NetBIOS Session) from 
10.0.0.2 (TCP Port 1032) [TCP Flags: S].<br>
<br>
Occurred: 2 times between 10/29/2002 7:38:20 AM and 10/29/2002 7:46:18 AM<br>
<br>
A Windows NT server on my home network, which has addresses that all start with 
10.0.0, caused these alerts. In this case the server was just doing its innocent 
thing, looking for other Windows computers on my LAN (local area network) that might 
need to network with it. Every now and then, however, an attacker might pretend 
to have an address from your internal network even though it is attacking from outside.<br>
<br>
If a computer from out on the Internet tries to open a NetBIOS session with one 
of mine, I&#39;ll be mighty suspicious. Here&#39;s one example of what an outside attack 
may look like:<br>
<br>
The firewall has blocked Internet access to your computer (NetBIOS Name) from 999.209.116.123 
(UDP Port 1028).<br>
<br>
Time: 10/30/2002 11:10:02 AM (The attacker&#39;s IP address has been altered to protect 
the innocent or the guilty, as the case may be.)<br>
<br>
Want to see how intensely crackers and worms are scanning the Internet for potential 
NetBIOS targets? A really great and free IDS for Windows that is also a firewall 
is Zone Alarm. You can download it for free from
<a href="http://www.zonelabs.com">http://www.zonelabs.com</a> . You can set it to 
pop up a warning on your screen whenever someone or some worm attacks your computer. 
You will almost certainly get a NetBIOS attack the first day you use your IDS.<br>
<br>
Do you need to worry when a NetBIOS attack hits? Only if you have enabled NetBIOS 
and Shares on your computer. Unfortunately, in order to explore other computers 
using NetBIOS, you increase the danger to your own computer from attack by NetBIOS. 
But, hey, to paraphrase a famous carpenter from Galilee, he who lives by the NetBIOS 
gets hacked by the NetBIOS.<br>
<br>
********************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface) is an out-of-date, 
crummy, not terribly secure way for Windows computers to communicate with each other 
in a peer-to-peer mode. NetBIOS stands for network basic input/output system.<br>
<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: Shares are when you make it so other computers can access files 
and directories on your computer. If you set up your computer to use NetBIOS, in 
Win XP using the NTFS (new technology file system) you can share files and directories 
by bringing up My Computer. Click on a directory - which in XP is called a &quot;folder&quot;. 
In the left-hand column a task will appear called &quot;Share this folder&quot;. By clicking 
this you can set who can access this folder, how many people at a time can access 
it, and what they can do with the folder.<br>
********************<br>
<br>
There are a number of network exploration commands that only NetBIOS uses. We will 
show how to use nbtstat and several versions of the net command.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Install NetBIOS<br>
</b><br>
You might have to make changes on your system in order to use these commands. Here&#39;s 
how to enable NetBIOS for Windows XP. (If you are stuck with Windows 95, 98, SE 
or ME, see the end of this Guide for how to enable NetBIOS.) Click:<br>
<br>
Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections <br>
<br>
There are two types of network connections that may appear here: &quot;Dial-up&quot; and &quot;LAN 
or High-Speed Internet&quot;.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: A dial-up connection uses a modem to reach the Internet. LAN 
stands for local area network. It&#39;s what you have if two or more computers are linked 
to each other with a cable instead of modems. Most schools and businesses have LANs, 
as well as homes with Internet connection sharing. A DSL or cable modem connection 
will also typically show up as a LAN connection. <br>
**************<br>
<br>
To configure your connections for hacking, double click on the connection you plan 
to use. That brings up a box that has a button labeled &quot;Properties&quot;. Clicking it 
brings up a box that says &quot;This connection uses the following items:&quot;<br>
<br>
You need to have both TCP/IP and NWLink NetBIOS showing. If NWLink NetBIOS is missing, 
here&#39;s how to add it. Click Install -&gt; Protocol -&gt; Add NWlink/IPX/SPX/NetBIOS Compatible 
Transport Protocol.<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: NWLink refers to Novell&#39;s Netware protocol for running a LAN.<br>
**************<br>
<br>
<b>How to Use Nbtstat<br>
</b><br>
To get started, bring up the cmd.exe command. Click Start -&gt; Run and type cmd.exe 
in the command line box. This brings up a black screen with white letters. Once 
it is up, we will play with the nbtstat command. To get help for this command, just 
type:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;nbtstat help<br>
<br>
One way to use the nbtstat command is to try to get information from another computer 
using either its domain name (for example test.target.com), its numerical Internet 
address (for example, happyhacker.org&#39;s numerical address is 206.61.52.30), or its 
NetBIOS name (if you are on the same LAN).<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;nbtstat -a 10.0.0.2&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<br>
To keep this Guide from being ridiculously long, we&#39;ll just explain a few of the 
things what we learned when we ran nbtstat -a against 10.0.0.2:<br>
<br>
* it uses NetBIOS<br>
* its NetBIOS name is Oldguy<br>
* one of the users is named Administrator<br>
* it runs a web site with Internet Information Server, and maybe an&nbsp;&nbsp; 
ftp - file transfer protocol -- server<br>
* it is a member of the domain Wargame<br>
* it is connected on a local area network and we accessed it through&nbsp;&nbsp; 
an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) with a MAC Address of&nbsp;&nbsp; 52-54-00-E4-6F-40.
<br>
<br>
When using nbtstat over the Internet, in most cases it will not find the correct 
MAC address. However, sometimes you get lucky. That is part of the thrill of legal 
hacker exploration. OK, OK, maybe getting a thrill out of a MAC address means I&#39;m 
some kind of a freak. But if you are reading this, you probably are freaky enough 
to be a hacker, too.<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: MAC stands for media access control. In theory every NIC ever 
made has a unique MAC address, one that no other NIC has. In practice, however, 
some manufacturers make NICs that allow you to change the MAC address. <br>
**************<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Evil Genius tip</i>: sneak your computer onto a LAN and use it to find the MAC 
address of a very interesting computer. Crash it, then give yours the same MAC, 
NetBIOS name and Internet address as the very interesting computer. Then see what 
you can do while faking being that computer. That&#39;s why I get a charge out of discovering 
a MAC address, so stop laughing at me already.<br>
**************<br>
<br>
**************<br>
You can get fired, expelled, busted and catch cooties warning: Faking all that stuff 
is something you would be better off doing only on your own test network, or with 
written permission from the owner of the very interesting computer.<br>
**************<br>
<br>
Now that we know some basic things about computer 10.0.0.2, also known as Oldguy, 
we can do some simple things to learn more. We can connect to it with a web browser 
to see what&#39;s on the web site, and with ftp to see if it allows anonymous users 
to download or upload files. In the case of Oldguy, anyone can browse the web site. 
However, when we try to connect to its ftp server with Netscape by giving the location
<a href="ftp://10.0.0.2,">ftp://10.0.0.2,</a> it returns the message &quot;User Mozilla@ 
cannot log in.<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: The people who programmed Netscape have always called it Mozilla, 
after a famous old movie monster. As a joke they have stuck obscure mentions of 
Mozilla into the operations of Netscape. Mozilla lovers recently spun off a pure 
Mozilla browser project that has the web site <a href="http://www.mozilla.org.">
http://www.mozilla.org.</a><br>
**************<br>
<br>
<b>The Net View Command<br>
</b><br>
Now let&#39;s have some serious fun. Netscape (or any browser or ftp program) uses TCP/IP 
to connect. What happens if we use NetBIOS instead to try to download files from 
Oldguy&#39;s ftp server?<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s try some more NetBIOS commands:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;net view \\10.0.0.2<br>
System error 53 has occurred.<br>
<br>
The network path was not found.<br>
<br>
I got this message because my firewall blocked access to Oldguy, giving the message:<br>
<br>
The firewall has blocked Internet access to 10.0.0.2 (TCP Port 445) from your computer 
[TCP Flags: S].<br>
<br>
There&#39;s a good reason for this. My firewall/IDS is trying to keep me from carelessly 
making my computer a part of some stranger&#39;s LAN. Keep in mind that NetBIOS is a 
two-way street. However, I want to run this command, so I shut down Zone Alarm and 
give the command again:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;net view \\10.0.0.2<br>
Shared resources at \\10.0.0.2<br>
<br>
Share name&nbsp; Type&nbsp; Used as&nbsp; Comment<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
ftproot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disk<br>
InetPub&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disk<br>
wwwroot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disk<br>
The command completed successfully.<br>
<br>
This is a list of shared directories. Oooh, look at that, the ftp server is shared. 
Does this mean I can get in? When setting shares on a Windows NT server, the default 
choice is to allow access to read, write and delete files to everyone. So sometimes 
a sysadmin carelessly fails to restrict access to a share. <br>
<br>
What is really important is that we didn&#39;t need a user name or password to get this 
potentially compromising information.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s establish an anonymous connection to Oldguy, meaning we connect without giving 
it a user name or password:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;net use \\10.0.0.2\ipc$<br>
Local name<br>
Remote name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\10.0.0.2\IPC$<br>
Resource type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPC<br>
Status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK<br>
# Opens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br>
# Connections&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
The command completed successfully. <br>
<br>
We are connected! <br>
<br>
**********************<br>
Newbie note: IPC (ipc$) stands for &quot;Inter Process Connector&quot;, used to set up connections 
across a network between Windows computers using NetBIOS.<br>
**********************<br>
<br>
<b>What to Do Once You Are Connected<br>
</b><br>
So far we haven&#39;t quite been breaking the law, although we have been getting pretty 
rude if the owner of that target computer hasn&#39;t given us permission to explore. 
What if we want to stop pushing our luck and decide to disconnect? Just give the 
message:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;net session \\10.0.0.2 /delete<br>
<br>
Of course you would substitute the name or number of the computer to which you are 
connected for 10.0.0.2.<br>
<br>
What if you want to stay connected? Oldguy will let you stay connected even if you 
do nothing more. By contrast, a login to a Unix/Linux type computer will normally 
time out and disconnect you if you go too long without doing anything.<br>
<br>
You could try out the other net commands on Oldguy. Or you can go to the graphical 
user interface (GUI) of XP. Click My Computer, then My Network Places and there 
you&#39;ll find the victim, er, I mean, target computer. By clicking on it, I discover 
that ftproot has been shared to - everyone! <br>
<br>
Let&#39;s say you were to get this far investigating some random computer you found 
on the Internet. Let&#39;s say you had already determined that the ftp server isn&#39;t 
open to the public. At this moment you would have a little angel sitting one shoulder 
whispering &quot;You can be a hero. Email the owner of that computer to tell him or her 
about that misconfigured ftproot.&quot; <br>
<br>
On the other shoulder a little devil is sneering, &quot;Show the luser no mercy. Information 
should be free. Because I said so, that&#39;s why. Hot darn, are those spreadsheets 
from the accounting department? You could make a lot of bucks selling those files 
to a competitor, muhahaha! Besides, you&#39;re so ugly that future cellmate Spike won&#39;t 
make you be his girlfriend.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some hackers might think that because ftproot is shared to the world that it is 
OK to download stuff from it. However, if someone were to log in properly to that 
ftp server, he or she would get the message &quot;Welcome to Oldguy on Carolyn Meinel&#39;s 
LAN. Use is restricted to only those for whom Meinel has assigned a user name and 
password.&quot; This warning logon banner is all a computer owner needs to legally establish 
that no one is allowed to just break in. It won&#39;t impress a judge if a cracker says 
&quot;The owner was so lame that her computer deserved to get broken into&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m so 
lame that I forgot to try to use the ftp server the normal way.&quot;<br>
<br>
<b>More on the Net Commands<br>
</b><br>
Let&#39;s get back to the net command. There are many forms of this command. In XP you 
can learn about them with the command:<br>
<br>

The syntax of this command is:<br>
<br>

<b>How Crackers Log on as Administrator<br>
</b><br>
As we look around Oldguy further, we see that there&#39;s not much else an anonymous 
user can do to it. We know that there is a user named Administrator. What can we 
do if we can convince Oldguy that we are Administrator?<br>
<br>
******************<br>
<i>Newbie note</i>: in Windows NT, 2000 and XP, the Administrator user has total 
power over its computer, just as root has total power over a Unix/Linux type computer. 
However, it is possible to change the name of Administrator so an attacker has to 
guess which user has all the power.<br>
******************<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s try to log in as Administrator by guessing the password. Give the command:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;net use \\10.0.0.2\ipc$ * /user:Administrator<br>
Type the password for \\10.0.0.2\ipc$:<br>
System error 1219 has occurred.<br>
<br>
Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more 
than one user name, are not allowed. Disconnect all previous connections to the 
server or shared resource and try again.<br>
<br>
This means that someone else is currently logged onto this server who has Administrator 
rights. Furthermore, this person is probably watching me on an IDS and thinking 
up terrible things to do to me. Eeep! Actually this is all going on inside my hacker 
lab - but you get the idea of what it could be like when trying to invade a computer 
without permission.<br>
<br>
I discover that whether I guess the password correctly or not, I always get the 
same error message. This is a good safety feature. On the other hand, one of the 
users is named Administrator. This is a bad thing for the defender. When you first 
set up a Windows NT or 2000 server, there is always a user called Administrator, 
and he or she has total power over that computer. If you know the all-powerful user 
is named Administrator, you can try guessing the password whenever no one is logged 
on with Administrator powers.<br>
<br>
Computer criminals don&#39;t waste time guessing by hand. They use a program such as 
NAT or Legion to get passwords. These programs are why smart NT administrators rename 
their Administrator accounts and choose hard passwords.&nbsp; Also, this kind of 
persistent attack will be detected by an intrusion detection system, making it easy 
to catch criminals at work.<br>
<br>
********************<br>
You can get expelled warning: What if you are a student and you want to save your 
school from malicious code kiddies who steal tests and change grades? It is important 
to get permission *in writing* before you test the school&#39;s network. Even then, 
you still must be careful to be a model student. If you act up, cut classes - you 
know what I mean - the first time a cracker messes up the network, who do you think 
they will suspect? Yes, it&#39;s unfair, and yes, that is the way the world works.<br>

<b>How to Scan for Computers that Use NetBIOS<br>
</b><br>
How do you find Windows computers that are running NetBIOS? Your tool of choice 
is a port scanner. Any computer that is running something on port 139 is likely 
(but not certain) to be using NetBIOS. Most crackers use nmap to port scan. This 
tool runs on Unix/Linux type computers. You can get it at
<a href="http://www.insecurity.org">http://www.insecurity.org</a> . There is also 
a Windows version of nmap, but it isn&#39;t very good. A better choice for Windows is 
Whats Up from <a href="http://www.ipswitch.com">http://www.ipswitch.com</a> . You 
can get a one month free trial of it.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s an example of an nmap scan of Oldguy:<br>
<br>
test-box:/home/cmeinel # nmap -sTU 10.0.0.2<br>
<br>
Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )<br>
Interesting ports on&nbsp; (10.0.0.2):<br>
(The 3060 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)<br>
Port&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Service<br>
21/tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ftp<br>
70/tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gopher<br>
80/tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http<br>
135/tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loc-srv<br>
135/udp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loc-srv<br>
137/udp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netbios-ns<br>
138/udp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netbios-dgm<br>
139/tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netbios-ssn<br>
500/udp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isakmp<br>
<br>
Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8 seconds<br>
<br>
As you can see from this scan, three ports are identified with NetBIOS. This tells 
us that we could set nmap to scan a large number of Internet addresses, only looking 
for port 139 on each. To learn how to set up nmap to run this way, in your Unix 
or Linux shell give the command &quot;man nmap&quot;.<br>
<br>
For more on what crackers do once they break into a computer using NetBIOS (like 
installing back doors), see
<a href="http://happyhacker.org/gtmhh/vol3no10.shtml">http://happyhacker.org/gtmhh/vol3no10.shtml</a> 
.<br>
<br>
********************<br>
You can get punched in the nose warning: If you use a port scanner against networks 
that haven&#39;t given you permission to scan, you will be waving a red flag that says 
&quot;Whaddaya wanna bet I&#39;m a computer criminal?&quot; You can&#39;t get arrested for merely 
port scanning, but people who don&#39;t like being scanned might get you kicked off 
your Internet service provider. <br>
<br>
You can get really, big time, punched in the nose warning: If you visit the same 
computer or LAN really often to see what&#39;s new and to try different things, even 
if you don&#39;t break the law you&#39;d better be doing it with the permission of the owner. 
Otherwise you may make enemies who might crash or destroy your operating system. 
And that is only what they may do when feeling mellow. After a night of hard drinking 
- well, you don&#39;t want to find out.<br>

<b>How to Play NetBIOS Wargames<br>
</b><br>
What if you want to challenge your friends to a hacker wargame using NetBIOS? The 
first thing to do is *don&#39;t* email me asking me to break in for you. Sheesh. Seriously, 
I get emails from people claiming to have permission from their girlfriend/boyfriend 
and begging me to help them break in. You can read their hilarious pleas for help 
at <a href="http://happyhacker.org/sucks/">http://happyhacker.org/sucks/</a> .<br>
<br>
The way to run a hacker wargame over the Internet is first, get permission from 
your Internet provider so they don&#39;t kick you off for hacking. They probably run 
an IDS that scans users for suspicious activity. They probably hate malicious hackers. 
Enough said.<br>
<br>
Second, you and your friends are likely to be at a different Internet address every 
time you log on. Your safest way to play over the Internet is for each player to 
get an Internet address that is the same every time he or she logs on: a &quot;static&quot; 
address. This way you won&#39;t accidentally break into someone else&#39;s computer.<br>
<br>
You have to arrange with your Internet provider to get a static address. Normally 
only a local provider can do this for you. A big advantage of using a local provider 
is you can make friends with the people who work there - and they are probably hackers.<br>
<br>
If you live in an apartment building or dormitory with other hackers, you can play 
break-in games without using the Internet. Set up a LAN where you can play together. 
For example, you can string Ethernet cable from window to window. To learn how to 
set up a Windows Ethernet LAN, see
<a href="http://happyhacker.org/gtmhh/winlan.shtml">http://happyhacker.org/gtmhh/winlan.shtml</a> 
.<br>
<br>
Or you could set up a wireless LAN. With wireless you never know who might come 
cruising with a laptop down the street by your home or business and break in. That 
can make a wargame lots more fun. For help on how to break into wireless LANs (it&#39;s 
pathetically easy and with care can be borderline legal), see
<a href="http://www.wardriving.com">http://www.wardriving.com</a> .<br>
<br>
**************<br>
<i>Evil genius tip</i>: Attack using a Win NT server with the Microsoft Resource 
Kit installed. Heh, heh. With it you can give the command:<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;Local Administrators \\&lt;targetbox.com&gt;<br>
<br>
This should show all user accounts with administrator rights on targetbox.com.<br>
<br>
C:\&gt;Global Administrators \\&lt;targetbox.com &gt;<br>
<br>
This should show all user accounts with Domain administrative rights.<br>
<br>
These are exceptionally worth compromising, because with one Domain administrative 
password you will be able to control many resources among NT servers, workstations, 
and Win 95/98 computers. <br>
<br>
I&#39;ve tried to install the Resource Kit on XP Professional, but it wasn&#39;t compatible.
<br>
<br>
Another option is to install hacker tools such as Red Button and DumpACL, which 
extract information on user names, hashes, and which services are running on a given 
machine. <br>

<br>
To enable NetBIOS, click<br>
<br>
Control Panel -&gt; Network -&gt; Protocols<br>
<br>
If you see both NetBEUI and TCP/IP, you are already using NetBIOS. If not, add NetBEUI.<br>
