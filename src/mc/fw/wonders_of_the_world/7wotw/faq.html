&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Q: Who compiled the list of the Seven Ancient Wonders?</b> </p>
<p>A: The first reference to the idea is found in </a>
<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.html"><i>History</i></a> of Herodotus 
as long ago as the 5th century BC. His list comprised the Pyramids, the Hanging 
Gardens, and the Walls of Babylon among others. Callimachus of Cyrene (305BC-240BC), 
Chief Librarian of the
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/History/legacy.html">Alexandria 
Mouseion</a>, wrote &quot;A Collection of Wonders around the World&quot;. All we know about 
the collection is its title, for it was destroyed with the Alexandria Library. The 
current list is sometimes attributed to the ancient poet and historian, Antipater 
of Sidon, although his list contained the Walls of Babylon in place of the Lighthouse 
of Alexandria. The final list of the Seven Wonders was compiled during the
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Humanities/History/Medieval_Studies/">Middle Ages</a> 
when they were first depicted by the great Dutch architect Maerten van Heemskerck.

<p><b>Q: Can I please use the color paintings of the Wonders?</b> </a></p>
<p>A: We do not own the copyright for the six paintings of the Wonders (all except 
the pyramid).&nbsp;&nbsp; Please <strong>do not request permission to use these 
paintings from us</strong>. These paintings were created by Mr. Mario Larrinaga, 
and are copyrighted by a currently defunct motion picture production company in 
Hollywood. If you need more information, you may consult the following reference:

<br>
<a name="forgotten"><b>Q: Why is the Taj Mahal/Great Wall/Pisa Tower not on the 
list?</b> </p>
<p>A: The original list was compiled by ancient Greek historians before the Taj 
Mahal or the Pisa Tower were built. These historians did not know of the existence 
of the Great Wall (which did not take its present shape until the Middle Ages anyway). 
When the Dutch architect Maerten van Heemskerck compiled the final list in the Middle 
Ages, he relied mostly on the ancient Greek sources. In this WWW site, we have devoted 
a complete section to some of the greatest </a>

<p><b>Q: Why is the Eiffel Tower/Statue of Liberty/Big Ben not on the list?</b>
</p>
<p>A: The original list was compiled by ancient Greek historians long before the 
Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and Big Ben were built. In this WWW site, we 
have devoted a complete section to some of the greatest </a>

<a name="whyonepyramid">
<pre></pre>
<p><b>Q: Why is only Khufu&#39;s Great Pyramid a wonder and not the pyramids surrounding 
it?</b> </p>
<p>A: The three Great Pyramids are sometimes referred to as a Wonder, but it is 
actually the Great Pyramid that is only listed. It appears that when Herodotus compiled 
his list, he properly attributed the pyramids to different builders. The Pyramid 
of Khufu was built first and therefore earns a special place compared to the other 
two pyramids that were modeled later after Khufu&#39;s. </p>
<p></a><a href="#top"><i>More FAQ&#39;s</i></a><br>
&nbsp;<a name="stones"></p>
<p><b>Q: Can you explain the casing of stones that used to be on the pyramid in 
more detail?</b> </p>
<p>A: The stone casing used to cover the Pyramids and form a smooth outer surface. 
Because of the good quality of this stone, it was stripped and used over the years 
to build other structures in Cairo. Most of this stone was used in Arab structures 
in Cairo, such as the great Citadel of Saladin. Some of the stone was also used 
to build houses, and a portion eroded naturally. The remianing portion of this stone 
can still be seen on top of Khafre&#39;s Pyramid. </p>
<p></a><a href="#top"><i>More FAQ&#39;s</i></a><br>
&nbsp;<a name="whyseven"></p>
<p><b>Q: Why are there exactly seven wonders? Why specifically this number?</b>
</p>
<p>A: There is no specific reason, although the number &quot;seven&quot; appears in many aspects 
of mythology and religion. People always talk about the seven gates of heaven, the 
seven days of the week, and the seven seas. It appears this number is somehow embedded 
in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern tradition and history. </p>

<a name="whichoneisbest">
<p><b>Q: Which wonder do you particularly like the best and why?</b> </p>
<p>A: Each Wonder has its own intrigue. Historian agree that the Pyramids stood 
the test of time, the Lighthouse is the only Wonder that has a practical secular 
use, and the Temple of Artemis was the most beautiful of all Wonders. </p>

&nbsp;<a name="semiramis"></p>
<p><b>Q: Was King Nebuchadnezzar wife happy with the garden?</b> </p>
<p>A: This information is not preperly documented anywhere. In fact, there is no 
historic evidence that the Gardens existed in the form we know. </p>

<a name="animals">
<p><b>Q: What kind of animals were in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon?</b> </p>
<p>A: This information is not preperly documented anywhere. In fact, there is no 
historic evidence that the Gardens existed in the form we know. Animals and plants 
that were in the Gardens, if any, would have been any kinds of animals and plants 
that could live in Mesopotamia&#39;s (present day Iraq) weather. </p>

&nbsp;<a name="lighthouseoperator"></p>
<p><b>Q: Who operated or supervised the light at the Pharos in Alexandria? Slaves? 
Special operators?</b> </p>
<p>A: There is no historic evidence that the Ptolemies used slaves to build or operate 
the lighthouse. It is possible that special operators supervised the lighthouse.

<a name="whywonders">
<p><b>Q: What makes all these structures &quot;wonders&quot;?</b> </p>
<p>A: These structures were viewed at the time when they were compiled as the greatest 
structures on earth. They combine elements of architecture, engineering, and religion, 
and in most cases (e.g. the Pyramid, the Colossus) symbolize the unity of the people 
who built them. </p>
