<p><b>ISDN</b>, which stands for <b>I</b>ntegrated <b>S</b>ervices <b>D</b>igital
<b>N</b>etwork, is a system of digital phone connections which has been available 
for over a decade. This system allows voice and data to be transmitted simultaneously 
across the world using end-to-end digital connectivity. </p>
<p>With ISDN, voice and data are carried by bearer channels (<b>B channels</b>) 
occupying a bandwidth of 64 kb/s (bits per second). Some switches limit B channels 
to a capacity of 56 kb/s. A data channel (<b>D channel</b>) handles signaling at 
16 kb/s or 64 kb/s, depending on the service type. Note that, in ISDN terminology, 
&quot;<b>k</b>&quot; means 1000 (10<sup>3</sup>), not 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>) as in many computer 
applications (the designator &quot;<b>K</b>&quot; is sometimes used to represent this value); 
therefore, a 64 kb/s channel carries data at a rate of 64000 b/s. A new
<a href="ISDN%20Tutorial/Prefixes%20For%20Binary%20Multiples.htm">set of standard prefixes</a> 
has recently been created to handle this. Under this scheme, &quot;k&quot; (kilo-) means 1000 
(10<sup>3</sup>), &quot;M&quot; (mega-) means 1000000 (10<sup>6</sup>), and so on, and &quot;Ki&quot; 
(kibi-) means 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>), &quot;Mi&quot; (mebi-) means 1048576 (2<sup>20</sup>), 
and so on. </p>
<p>(An alert reader pointed out some inconsistencies in my use of unit terminology 
throughout this Tutorial. He also referred me to a
<a href="http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/">definitive web site</a>. As a result, I have 
made every effort to both conform to standard terminology, and to use it consistently. 
I appreciate helpful user input like this!) </p>
<p>There are two basic types of ISDN service: <b>Basic Rate Interface</b> (<b>BRI</b>) 
and <b>Primary Rate Interface</b> (<b>PRI</b>). BRI consists of two 64 kb/s B channels 
and one 16 kb/s D channel for a total of 144 kb/s. This basic service is intended 
to meet the needs of most individual users. </p>
<p>PRI is intended for users with greater capacity requirements. Typically the channel 
structure is 23 B channels plus one 64 kb/s D channel for a total of 1536 kb/s. 
In Europe, PRI consists of 30 B channels plus one 64 kb/s D channel for a total 
of 1984 kb/s. It is also possible to support multiple PRI lines with one 64 kb/s 
D channel using <b>Non-Facility Associated Signaling (NFAS)</b>. </p>
<p>H channels provide a way to aggregate B channels. They are implemented as:

<p>To access BRI service, it is necessary to subscribe to an ISDN phone line. Customer 
must be within 18000 feet (about 3.4 miles or 5.5 km) of the telephone company central 
office for BRI service; beyond that, expensive repeater devices are required, or 
ISDN service may not be available at all. Customers will also need special equipment 
to communicate with the phone company switch and with other ISDN devices. These 
devices include ISDN <b>Terminal Adapters</b> (sometimes called, incorrectly, &quot;ISDN 
Modems&quot;) and <b>ISDN Routers</b>. </p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="ISDN History">ISDN History</a></h3>
<p>The early phone network consisted of a pure analog system that connected telephone 
users directly by a mechanical interconnection of wires. This system was very inefficient, 
was very prone to breakdown and noise, and did not lend itself easily to long-distance 
connections. Beginning in the 1960s, the telephone system gradually began converting 
its internal connections to a packet-based, digital switching system. Today, nearly 
all voice switching in the U.S. is digital within the telephone network. Still, 
the final connection from the local central office to the customer equipment was, 
and still largely is, an analog Plain-Old Telephone Service (POTS) line. </p>
<p>A standards movement was started by the International Telephone and Telegraph 
Consultative Committee (CCITT), now known as the
<a href="http://www.itu.ch/" target="_blank">International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU)</a>. The ITU is a <a href="http://www.un.org/" target="_blank">United Nations</a> 
organization that coordinates and standardizes international telecommunications. 
Original recommendations of ISDN were in CCITT Recommendation I.120 (1984) which 
described some initial guidelines for implementing ISDN. </p>
<p>Local phone networks, especially the regional Bell operating companies, have 
long hailed the system, but they had been criticized for being slow to implement 
ISDN. One good reason for the delay is the fact that the two major switch manufacturers,
<a href="http://www.nortelnetworks.com/" target="_blank">Northern Telecom</a> (now 
known as <a href="http://www.nortelnetworks.com/" target="_blank">Nortel Networks</a>), 
and <a href="http://www.att.com/" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a> (whose switch business 
is now owned by <a href="http://www.lucent.com/" target="_blank">Lucent Technologies</a>), 
selected different ways to implement the CCITT standards. These standards didn&#39;t 
always interoperate. This situation has been likened to that of earlier 19th century 
railroading. &quot;People had different gauges, different tracks... nothing worked well.&quot;
</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, an industry-wide effort began to establish a specific implementation 
for ISDN in the U.S. Members of the industry agreed to create the National ISDN 
1 (<b>NI-1</b>) standard so that end users would not have to know the brand of switch 
they are connected to in order to buy equipment and software compatible with it. 
However, there were problems agreeing on this standard. In fact, many western states 
would not implement NI-1. Both <a href="http://www.sbc.com/" target="_blank">Southwestern 
Bell</a> and <a href="http://www.uswest.com/" target="_blank">U.S. West</a> (now
<a href="http://www.qwest.com/" target="_blank">Qwest</a>) said that they did not 
plan to deploy NI-1 software in their central office switches due to incompatibilities 
with their existing ISDN networks. </p>
<p>Ultimately, all the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) did support NI-1. 
A more comprehensive standardization initiative, National ISDN 2 (<b>NI-2</b>), 
was later adopted. Some manufacturers of ISDN communications equipment, such as
<a href="http://www.mot.com/" target="_blank">Motorola</a> and
<a href="http://www.usr.com/" target="_blank">U S Robotics</a> (now owned by
<a href="http://www.3com.com/" target="_blank">3Com</a>), worked with the RBOCs 
to develop configuration standards for their equipment. These kinds of actions, 
along with more competitive pricing, inexpensive ISDN connection equipment, and 
the desire for people to have relatively low-cost high-bandwidth Internet access 
have made ISDN more popular in recent years. </p>
<p>Most recently, ISDN service has largely been displaced by broadband internet 
service, such as xDSL and Cable Modem service. These services are faster, less expensive, 
and easier to set up and maintain than ISDN. Still, ISDN has its place, as backup 
to dedicated lines, and in locations where broadband service is not yet available.

<h3 align="center"><a name="Advantages Of ISDN">Advantages Of ISDN</a></h3>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>The modem was a big breakthrough in computer communications. It allowed computers 
to communicate by converting their digital information into an analog signal to 
travel through the public phone network. There is an upper limit to the amount of 
information that an analog telephone line can hold. Currently, it is about 56 kb/s 
bidirectionally. Commonly available modems have a maximum speed of
<a href="http://www.56k.com/">56 kb/s</a>, but are limited by the quality of the 
analog connection and routinely go about 45-50 kb/s. Some phone lines do not support 
56 kb/s connections at all. There were currently 2 competing, incompatible 56 kb/s 
standards (<a href="http://x2.usr.com/">X2</a> from
<a href="http://www.usr.com/">U S Robotics</a> (recently bought by
<a href="http://www.3com.com/">3Com</a>), and <a href="http://www.k56.com/">K56flex</a> 
from <a href="http://www.rockwell.com/">Rockwell</a>/<a href="http://www.lucent.com/">Lucent</a>). 
This standards problem was resolved when the <a href="http://www.itu.ch/">ITU</a> 
released the V.90, and later V.92, standard for 56 kb/s modem communications.
</p>
<p>ISDN allows multiple digital channels to be operated simultaneously through the 
same regular phone wiring used for analog lines. The change comes about when the 
telephone company&#39;s switches can support digital connections. Therefore, the same 
physical wiring can be used, but a digital signal, instead of an analog signal, 
is transmitted across the line. This scheme permits a much higher data transfer 
rate than analog lines. BRI ISDN, using a channel aggregation protocol such as
<a href="http://www.adtran.com/support/faqs/isdn/bmppp_listing.html">BONDING or 
Multilink-PPP</a>, supports an uncompressed data transfer speed of 128 kb/s, plus 
bandwidth for overhead and signaling. In addition, the latency, or the amount of 
time it takes for a communication to begin, on an ISDN line is typically about half 
that of an analog line. This improves response for interactive applications, such 
as games. </p>
<h3>Multiple Devices</h3>
<p>Previously, it was necessary to have a separate phone line for each device you 
wished to use simultaneously. For example, one line each was required for a telephone, 
fax, computer, bridge/router, and live video conference system. Transferring a file 
to someone while talking on the phone or seeing their live picture on a video screen 
would require several potentially expensive phone lines. </p>
<p>ISDN allows multiple devices to share a single line. It is possible to combine 
many different digital data sources and have the information routed to the proper 
destination. Since the line is digital, it is easier to keep the noise and interference 
out while combining these signals. ISDN technically refers to a specific set of 
digital services provided through a single, standard interface. Without ISDN, distinct 
interfaces are required instead. </p>
<h3>Signaling</h3>
<p>Instead of the phone company sending a ring voltage signal to ring the bell in 
your phone (&quot;In-Band signal&quot;), it sends a digital packet on a separate channel (&quot;Out-of-Band 
signal&quot;). The Out-of-Band signal does not disturb established connections, no bandwidth 
is taken from the data channels, and call setup time is very fast. For example, 
a V.90 or V.92 modem typically takes 30-60 seconds to establish a connection; an 
ISDN call setup usually takes less than 2 seconds. </p>
<p>The signaling also indicates who is calling, what type of call it is (data/voice), 
and what number was dialed. Available ISDN phone equipment is then capable of making 
intelligent decisions on how to direct the call. </p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Interfaces">Interfaces</a></h3>
<p>In the U.S., the telephone company provides its BRI customers with a <b>U interface</b>. 
The U interface is a two-wire (single pair) interface from the phone switch, the 
same physical interface provided for POTS lines. It supports full-duplex data transfer 
over a single pair of wires, therefore only a single device can be connected to 
a U interface. This device is called an <b>Network Termination 1 (NT-1)</b>. The 
situation is different elsewhere in the world, where the phone company is allowed 
to supply the NT-1, and thereby the customer is given an S/T interface. </p>
<p>The NT-1 is a relatively simple device that converts the 2-wire U interface into 
the 4-wire <b>S/T interface</b>. The S/T interface supports multiple devices (up 
to 7 devices can be placed on the S/T bus) because, while it is still a full-duplex 
interface, there is now a pair of wires for receive data, and another for transmit 
data. Today, many devices have NT-1s built into their design. This has the advantage 
of making the devices less expensive and easier to install, but often reduces flexibility 
by preventing additional devices from being connected. </p>
<p>Technically, ISDN devices must go through an <b>Network Termination 2 (NT-2)</b> 
device, which converts the T interface into the S interface (Note: the S and T interfaces 
are electrically equivalent). Virtually all ISDN devices include an NT-2 in their 
design. The NT-2 communicates with terminal equipment, and handles the Layer 2 and 
3 ISDN protocols. Devices most commonly expect either a U interface connection (these 
have a built-in NT-1), or an S/T interface connection. </p>
<p>Devices that connect to the S/T (or S) interface include ISDN capable telephones 
and FAX machines, video teleconferencing equipment, bridge/routers, and terminal 
adapters. All devices that are designed for ISDN are designated <b>Terminal Equipment 
1 (TE1)</b>. All other communication devices that are <i>not</i> ISDN capable, but 
have a POTS telephone interface (also called the <b>R interface</b>), including 
ordinary analog telephones, FAX machines, and modems, are designated <b>Terminal 
Equipment 2 (TE2)</b>. A <b>Terminal Adapters (TA)</b> connects a TE2 to an ISDN 
S/T bus. </p>
<p>Going one step in the opposite direction takes us inside the telephone switch. 
Remember that the U interface connects the switch to the customer premises equipment. 
This local loop connection is called <i>Line Termination</i> (LT function). The 
connection to other switches within the phone network is called <i>Exchange Termination</i> 
(ET function). The LT function and the ET function communicate via the <b>V interface</b>.

The U interface provided by the telco for BRI is a 2-wire, 160 kb/s digital connection. 
Echo cancellation is used to reduce noise, and data encoding schemes (2B1Q in North 
America, 4B3T in Europe) permit this relatively high data rate over ordinary single-pair 
local loops. </p>
<h4>2B1Q</h4>
<p>2B1Q (2 Binary 1 Quaternary) is the most common signaling method on U interfaces. 
This protocol is defined in detail in 1988 ANSI spec T1.601. In summary, 2B1Q provides:

<h4>Establishing the Link Layer</h4>
<p>The Layer 2 establishment process is very similar to the X.25 LAP-B setup, if 
you are familiar with it. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The TE (Terminal Endpoint) and the Network initially exchange Receive Ready 
  (RR) frames, listening for someone to initiate a connection </li>
  <li>The TE sends an Unnumbered Information (UI) frame with a SAPI of 63 (management 
  procedure, query network) and TEI of 127 (broadcast) </li>
  <li>The Network assigns an available TEI (in the range 64-126) </li>
  <li>The TE sends a Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABME) frame with a SAPI of 
  0 (call control, used to initiate a SETUP) and a TEI of the value assigned by 
  the network </li>
  <li>The network responds with an Unnumbered Acknowledgement (UA), SAPI=0, TEI=assigned.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the connection is ready for a Layer 3 setup.</p>

<p>The ISDN Network Layer is also specified by the ITU
<a href="http://www.itu.ch/publications/itu-t/itutq.htm">Q-series documents</a> 
Q.930 through Q.939. Layer 3 is used for the establishment, maintenance, and termination 
of logical network connections between two devices. </p>
<h4>SPIDs</h4>
<p>Service Profile IDs (SPIDs) are used to identify what services and features the 
telco switch provides to the attached ISDN device. SPIDs are optional; when they 
are used, they are only accessed at device initialization time, before the call 
is set up. The format of the SPID is defined in a recommendation document, but it 
is only rarely followed. It is usually the 10-digit phone number of the ISDN line, 
plus a prefix and a suffix that are sometimes used to identify features on the line, 
but in reality it can be whatever the telco decides it should be. If an ISDN line 
requires a SPID, but it is not correctly supplied, then Layer 2 initialization will 
take place, but Layer 3 will not, and the device will not be able to place or accept 
calls. See ITU spec Q.932 for details. </p>
<h4>Information Field Structure</h4>
<p>The Information Field is a variable length field that contains the Q.931 protocol 
data. </p>
