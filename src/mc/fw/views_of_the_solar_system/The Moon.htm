<!-- INBODYEND -->The Moon has fascinated mankind throughout the ages. By simply 
viewing with the naked eye, one can discern two major types of terrain: relatively 
bright highlands and darker plains. By the middle of the 17th century, Galileo and 
other early astronomers made telescopic observations, noting an almost endless overlapping 
of craters. It has also been known for more than a century that the Moon is less 
dense than the Earth. Although a certain amount of information was ascertained about 
the Moon before the space age, this new era has revealed many secrets barely imaginable 
before that time. Current knowledge of the Moon is greater than for any other solar 
system object except Earth. This lends to a greater understanding of geologic processes 
and further appreciation of the complexity of terrestrial planets.
<p>On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first man to step onto the surface 
of the Moon. He was followed by Edwin Aldrin, both of the Apollo 11 mission. They 
and other moon walkers experienced the effects of no atmosphere. Radio communications 
were used because sound waves can only be heard by travelling through the medium 
of air. The lunar sky is always black because diffraction of light requires an atmosphere. 
The astronauts also experienced gravitational differences. The moon&#39;s gravity is 
one-sixth that of the Earth&#39;s; a man who <a href="terms.htm#weight">weighs</a> 180 
lbf (pound-force) on Earth weighs only 30 lbf on the Moon. (The equivalent metric 
weight (or force) is the Newton, where 4.45 Newtons equal one pound-force.) </p>
<p>The Moon is 384,403 kilometers (238,857 miles) distant from the Earth. Its diameter 
is 3,476 kilometers (2,160 miles). Both the rotation of the Moon and its revolution 
around Earth takes 27 days, 7 hours, and 43 minutes. This synchronous rotation is 
caused by an unsymmetrical distribution of mass in the Moon, which has allowed Earth&#39;s 
gravity to keep one lunar hemisphere permanently turned toward Earth. Optical librations 
have been observed telescopically since the mid-17th century. Very small but real 
librations (maximum about 0°.04) are caused by the effect of the Sun&#39;s gravity and 
the eccentricity of Earth&#39;s orbit, perturbing the Moon&#39;s orbit and allowing cyclical 
preponderances of torque in both east-west and north-south directions. </p>
<p>Four nuclear powered seismic stations were installed during the Apollo project 
to collect seismic data about the interior of the Moon. There is only residual tectonic 
activity due to cooling and tidal forcing, but other moonquakes have been caused 
by meteor impacts and artificial means, such as deliberately crashing the Lunar 
Module into the moon. The results have shown the Moon to have a crust 60 kilometers 
(37 miles) thick at the center of the near side. If this crust is uniform over the 
Moon, it would constitute about 10% of the Moon&#39;s volume as compared to the less 
than 1% on Earth. The seismic determinations of a crust and mantle on the Moon indicate 
a layered planet with differentiation by igneous processes. There is no evidence 
for an iron-rich core unless it were a small one. Seismic information has influenced 
theories about the formation and evolution of the Moon. </p>
<p>The Moon was heavily bombarded early in its history, which caused many of the 
original rocks of the ancient crust to be thoroughly mixed, melted, buried, or obliterated. 
Meteoritic impacts brought a variety of &quot;exotic&quot; rocks to the Moon so that samples 
obtained from only 9 locations produced many different rock types for study. The 
impacts also exposed Moon rocks of great depth and distributed their fragments laterally 
away from their places of origin, making them more accessible. The underlying crust 
was also thinned and cracked, allowing molten basalt from the interior to reach 
the surface. Because the Moon has neither an atmosphere nor any water, the components 
in the soils do not weather chemically as they would on Earth. Rocks more than 4 
billion years old still exist there, yielding information about the early history 
of the solar system that is unavailable on Earth. Geological activity on the Moon 
consists of occasional large impacts and the continued formation of the regolith. 
It is thus considered geologically dead. With such an active early history of bombardment 
and a relatively abrupt end of heavy impact activity, the Moon is considered fossilized 
in time. </p>
<p>The Apollo and Luna missions returned 382 kilograms (840 pounds) of rock and 
soil from which three major surface materials have been studied: the regolith, the 
maria, and the terrae. Micrometeorite bombardment has thoroughly pulverized the 
surface rocks into a fine-grained debris called the regolith. The regolith, or lunar 
soil, is unconsolidated mineral grains, rock fragments, and combinations of these 
which have been welded by impact-generated glass. It is found over the entire Moon, 
with the exception of steep crater and valley walls. It is 2 to 8 meters (7 to 26 
feet) thick on the maria and may exceed 15 meters (49 feet) on the terrae, depending 
on how long the bedrock underneath it has been exposed to meteoritic bombardment.
</p>
<p>The dark, relatively lightly cratered maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface 
and is concentrated on the nearside of the Moon, mostly within impact basins. This 
concentration may be explained by the fact that the Moon&#39;s center of mass is offset 
from its geometric center by about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) in the direction of 
Earth, probably because the crust is thicker on the farside. It is possible, therefore, 
that basalt magmas rising from the interior reached the surface easily on the nearside, 
but encountered difficulty on the farside. Mare rocks are basalt and most date from 
3.8 to 3.1 billion years. Some fragments in highland breccias date to 4.3 billion 
years and high resolution photographs suggest some mare flows actually embay young 
craters and may thus be as young as 1 billion years. The maria average only a few 
hundred meters in thickness but are so massive they frequently deformed the crust 
underneath them which created <a HREF="terms.htm#fault">fault</a>-like depressions 
and raised ridges. </p>
<p>The relatively bright, heavily cratered highlands are called terrae. The craters 
and basins in the highlands are formed by meteorite impact and are thus older than 
the maria, having accumulated more craters. The dominant rock type in this region 
contain high contents of plagioclase feldspar (a mineral rich in calcium and aluminum) 
and are a mixture of crustal fragments brecciated by meteorite impacts. Most terrae 
breccias are composed of still older breccia fragments. Other terrae samples are 
fine-grained crystalline rocks formed by shock melting due to the high pressures 
of an impact event. Nearly all of the highland breccias and impact melts formed 
about 4.0 to 3.8 billion years ago. The intense bombardment began 4.6 billion years 
ago, which is the estimated time of the Moon&#39;s origin. </p>

<b>The Lunar Interior</b> <br>
This picture shows the 3 major divisions of the Lunar interior, the crust, mantle, 
and core. The lunar crust thickness varies from tens of kilometers in depth (under 
mare basins) to more than 100 kilometers in some highland regions, with an average 
thickness of about 70 kilometers. The core radius is between 300 and 425 kilometers.

<b>2004 Lunar Eclipse</b> <br>
On Wednesday October 27, 2004 the moon passed into Earth&#39;s shadow for more than 
three hours. It began at 9:14 p.m EST with totality beginning at 10:23 p.m. and 
ending at 11:45 p.m. The eclipse passed out of Earth shadow at 00:54 a.m (Oct. 28).

<b>Moon - False Color Mosaic</b> <br>
This false-color photograph of the Moon was taken by the Galileo spacecraft on December 
8, 1992. The false-color processing used to create this lunar image is helpful for 
interpreting the surface soil composition. Areas appearing red generally correspond 
to the lunar highlands, while blue to orange shades indicate the ancient volcanic 
lava flow of a mare, or lunar sea. Bluer mare areas contain more titanium than do 
the orange regions. Mare Tranquillitatis, seen as a deep blue patch on the right, 
is richer in titanium than Mare Serenitatis, a slightly smaller circular area immediately 
adjacent to the upper left of Mare Tranquillitatis. Blue and orange areas covering 
much of the left side of the Moon in this view represent many separate lava flows 
in Oceanus Procellarum. The small purple areas found near the center are pyroclastic 
deposits formed by explosive volcanic eruptions. The fresh crater Tycho, with a 
diameter of 85 kilometers (53 miles), is prominent at the bottom of the photograph.

This mosaic is composed of 1,500 Clementine images of the south polar region of

to be a major depression near the lunar south pole (center), evident from the presence 
of extensive shadows around the pole. This depression probably is an ancient basin 
formed by the impact of an asteroid or comet. A significant portion of the dark

<b>Apollo 11</b> <br>
The Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) ascent stage, with Astronauts Neil A. Armstrong 
and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. aboard, is photographed from the Command and Service Module 
(CSM) during rendezvous in lunar orbit. The LM was making its docking approach to 
the CSM. Astronaut Michael Collins remained with the CSM in lunar orbit while the 
other two crewmen explored the lunar surface. The large, dark-colored area in the 
background is Smyth&#39;s Sea, centered at 85 degrees east longitude and 2 degrees south 
latitude on the lunar surface (nearside). This view looks west. The Earth rises

<b>Apollo 17 - Orange Soil</b> <br>
These orange glass spheres and fragments are the finest particles ever brought back 
from the Moon. The particles range in size from 20 to 45 microns. The orange soil 
was brought back from the Taurus-Littrow landing site by the apollo 17 crewmen. 
Scientist-Astronaut Harrison J. Schmitt discovered the orange soil at Shorty Crater. 
The orange particles, which are intermixed with black and black-speckled grains, 
are about the same size as the particles that compose silt on Earth. Chemical analysis 
of the orange soil material has show the sample to be similar to some of the samples 
brought back from the Apollo 11 (Sea of Tranquility) site several hundred miles 
to the southwest. Like those samples, it is rich in titanium (8%) and iron oxide 
(22%). But unlike the Apollo 11 samples, the orange soil is unexplainably rich in 
zinc. The orange soil is probably of volcanic origin and not the product of meteorite 
impact. <i>(Courtesy NASA)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Limb of Copernicus Impact Crater</b> <br>
This image of Copernicus was acquired on the Lunar Orbiter 5 Mission. Copernicus 
is 93 kilometers wide and is located within the Mare Imbrium Basin, northern nearside 
of the Moon (10° N, 20° degrees W.). Image shows crater floor, floor mounds, rim, 
and rayed ejecta. Rays from the ejecta are superposed on all other surrounding terrains 
which places the crater in its namesake age group: the Copernican system, established 
as the youngest assemblage of rocks on the Moon (Shoemaker and Hackman, 1962, The 
Moon: London, Academic Press, p.289-300). <i>(Courtesy USGS/NASA)</i>
