    <td width="100%">Web style sheets have been around for a number of years, but 
    their power and importance went largely unnoticed since few implementations 
    existed. Web authors, anxious to add creativity to their pages by influencing 
    the presentation, began to use Netscape&#39;s proprietary extensions rather than 
    the more powerful style sheets. This was quite natural, since Netscape&#39;s proprietary 
    extensions could be seen by a significant portion of Web users, while few would 
    see style sheet enhancements.<p>Today, more and more browsers are implementing 
    style sheets, opening authors&#39; eyes to unique features that allow influence 
    over presentation while preserving platform independence. The advantages of 
    style sheets became apparent, as did the disadvantages of continually creating 
    more HTML tags for presentation effects.</p>
    <p>Netscape&#39;s <strong class="html">BODY</strong> attributes are now widely accepted 
    on the Web, and have become standardized in
    <a href="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/">HTML 3.2</a>. Yet
    <strong class="html">BGCOLOR</strong>, <strong class="html">TEXT</strong> and 
    friends simply do not provide the flexibility of style sheets. Most background 
    images would leave a page unreadable to someone whose display only offered 16 
    colors; many pages are difficult to read with only 256 colors. With conventional
    <strong class="html">BODY</strong> attributes, an author must choose whether 
    the benefits of a background image outweigh the costs; with style sheets, an 
    author can offer a number of different images, in different style sheets, so 
    that the user can choose the &quot;24-bit style sheet&quot; or &quot;8-bit style sheet,&quot; depending 
    on how many colors his or her system can display. If no author-supplied style 
    suits the user, he or she can simply ignore the author&#39;s style.</p>
    <p>Style sheets can make an author&#39;s life much easier. While one could use
    <strong class="html">&lt;HR WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; SIZE=5 ALIGN=center&gt;</strong> for every 
    horizontal rule, this becomes very cumbersome for the author. With style sheets, 
    one only needs to specify such presentational preferences <em>once</em>, and 
    the style can be applied to an entire site. And if the author decides that
    <strong class="html">WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot;</strong> would be better, then he or she only 
    needs to change this preference in <em>one place</em>, rather than having to 
    search through hundreds of pages to change the HTML. Not only that, but style 
    sheets also reduce download time when one file contains all the style information.</p>
    <p>Style sheets also offer much more flexibility in terms of the presentation 
    effects that they provide. Properties such as color, background, margin, border, 
    and many more can be applied to <em>all elements</em>. With just HTML and its 
    proprietary extensions, one must rely on attributes like
    <strong class="html">BGCOLOR</strong>, which are only available for a few elements. 
    Style sheets give the flexibility of applying a style to all paragraphs, or 
    all level-two headings, or all emphasized text.</p>
    <p>With style sheets, authors can use the <strong class="css">
    <a href="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/css/text/text-indent.html">text-indent</a></strong> 
    property to indent text, rather than resorting to ugly kludges like
    <strong class="html">&lt;DD&gt;</strong> or <strong class="html">&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;blank.gif&quot; 
    WIDTH=10 ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;</strong> that carry with them many negative side-effects. Margins 
    can be suggested without having to put the entire page in a table. Style sheets 
    also reduce the need for multi-file search and replace; if an author decides 
    to change the indentation of all paragraphs on a site, he or she only has to 
    change one line on a style sheet.</p>
    <p>Style sheets represent an enormous step forward for the Web. With the separation 
    of content and presentation between HTML and style sheets, the Web no longer 
    needs to drift away from the strong ideal of platform independence that provided 
    the medium with its initial push of popularity. Authors can finally influence 
    the presentation of documents without leaving pages unreadable to users.</p>
