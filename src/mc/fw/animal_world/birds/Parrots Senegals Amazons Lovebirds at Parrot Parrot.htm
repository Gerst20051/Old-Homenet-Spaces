Again! </P>
<P align=center>Review of Parrot Training Courses / Videos by Chet and David 
Womach</P>
<P align=left>If there are two types of e-mails I get more than any other from 
my Parrot Parrot website, they are e-mails about biting and screaming. When I 
heard about the Womach's parrot training videos I was skeptical - I've seen some 
bird trainers in action and never found the techniques useful to the average 
bird owner. HOWEVER, I was in for a very pleasant surprise. </P>
<P align=left>These <A 
href="http://birdtricks.infusionsoft.com/go/ttt1/rmagick/"><U>parrot training 
videos</U></A> are simply fantastic! </P>
<P align=left>The Womachs use gentle encouragement and positive reinforcement to 
train their parrots. You see them doing the training in real time, so you get a 
real treat as you watch a bird IN A MATTER OF MINUTES go from unwilling to step 
up to letting someone pet their back.</P>
<P align=left>What makes these videos really special is the obvious love and 
respect the Womach's have for their beautiful birds. Frankly, I have never seen 
anything like it. The trainers and the parrots seem to be having the time of 
their lives. I immediately tried "The Wave" with my amazon, and she started to 
pick it up in a few minutes. </P>
<P align=left>My birds are pretty well trained - but they have a few bad habits 
(such as occasionally deciding it is NOT time to step up from their tree tower 
to go back to the cage). And the videos showed some techniques I have never 
tried. I know and use basic stick training (a MUST for amazons who can get very 
hormonal at times), but their technique is so obviously better than mine - how 
they use the sticks without inadvertently encouraging even more aggression is a 
very effective parrot training technique. </P>
<P align=left>I highly recommend their parrot training videos, and they even 
offer a free e-training course - <A 
href="http://birdtricks.infusionsoft.com/go/ttt1/rmagick/" target=_new><U>just 
click here to visit their website. </U></A></P>
<P align=left>I think anyone who gets a taste of their training methods will 
want to try the whole course. They eventually get into advanced tricks, so you 
can teach your parrot as much as you want by putting aside a few minutes each 
day. </P>
<P align=left>If you are one of the hundreds of people who email me every year 
begging for help with an out of control parrot, this is definitely an incredible 
parrot training system that can save that relationship with your bird.</P>
<P align=left><A 
href="http://birdtricks.infusionsoft.com/go/ttt1/rmagick/"><U>You can visit 
their site and find out about the free parrot training course by clicking here. 
</U></A></P>
<P align=left><BR>One final word - lately I've received quite a few e-mails from 
desperate people who are considering giving up their birds. It is a sad fact 
that birds are abandoned, adopted, re-abandoned, and re-adopted at an alarming 
rate. I truly believe if you love your pet bird and are willing to dedicate a 
little time each day to using easy yet effective training methods, you can turn 
around even the most obstinate parrot. </P>
<P align=left>Before you decide to give up on your bird, give these<A 
href="http://birdtricks.infusionsoft.com/go/ttt1/rmagick/"> parrot training 
videos </A>a try! The first step is FREE so take advantage of it! </P>
