<!--body here-->
<p><b>(1493)</b></p>
<p>As I know you will be rejoiced at the glorious success that our Lord has given 
me in my voyage, I write this to tell you how in thirty-three days I sailed to the 
Indies with the fleet that the illustrious King and Queen, our Sovereigns, gave 
me, where I discovered a great many islands, inhabited by numberless people; and 
of all I have taken possession for their Highnesses by proclamation and display 
of the Royal Standard without opposition. To the first island I discovered I gave 
the name of San Salvador, in commemoration of His Divine Majesty, who has wonderfully 
granted all this. The Indians call it Guanaham. The second I named the Island of 
Santa Maria de Concepcion; the third, Fernandina; the fourth, Isabella; the fifth, 
Juana; and thus to each one I gave a new name. When I came to Juana, I followed 
the coast of that isle toward the west, and found it so extensive that I thought 
it might be the mainland, the province of Cathay; and as I found no towns nor villages 
on the sea-coast, except a few small settlements, where it was impossible to speak 
to the people, because they fled at once, I continued the said route, thinking I 
could not fail to see some great cities or towns; and finding at the end of many 
leagues that nothing new appeared, and that the coast led northward, contrary to 
my wish, because the winter had already set in, I decided to make for the south, 
and as the wind also was against my proceeding, I determined not to wait there longer, 
and turned back to a certain harbor whence I sent two men to find out whether there 
was any king or large city. They explored for three days, and found countless small 
communities and people, without number, but with no kind of government, so they 
returned.</p>
<p>I heard from other Indians I had already taken that this land was an island, 
and thus followed the eastern coast for one hundred and seven leagues, until I came 
to the end of it. From that point I saw another isle to the eastward, at eighteen 
leagues&#39; distance, to which I gave the name of Hispaniola. I went thither and followed 
its northern coast to the east, as I had done in Juana, one hundred and seventy-eight 
leagues eastward, as in Juana. This island, like all the others, is most extensive. 
It has many ports along the sea-coast excelling any in Christendom — and many fine, 
large, flowing rivers. The land there is elevated, with many mountains and peaks 
incomparably higher than in the centre isle. They are most beautiful, of a thousand 
varied forms, accessible, and full of trees of endless varieties, so high that they 
seem to touch the sky, and I have been told that they never lose their foliage. 
I saw them as green and lovely as trees are in Spain in the month of May. Some of 
them were covered with blossoms, some with fruit, and some in other conditions, 
according to their kind. The nightingale and other small birds of a thousand kinds 
were singing in the month of November when I was there. There were palm trees of 
six or eight varieties, the graceful peculiarities of each one of them being worthy 
of admiration as are the other trees, fruits and grasses. There are wonderful pine 
woods, and very extensive ranges of meadow land. There is honey, and there are many 
kinds of birds, and a great variety of fruits. Inland there are numerous mines of 
metals and innumerable people. Hispaniola is a marvel. Its hills and mountains, 
fine plains and open country, are rich and fertile for planting and for pasturage, 
and for building towns and villages. The seaports there are incredibly fine, as 
also the magnificent rivers, most of which bear gold. The trees, fruits and grasses 
differ widely from those in Juana. There are many spices and vast mines of gold 
and other metals in this island. They have no iron, nor steel, nor weapons, nor 
are they fit for them, because although they are well-made men of commanding stature, 
they appear extraordinarily timid. The only arms they have are sticks of cane, cut 
when in seed, with a sharpened stick at the end, and they are afraid to use these. 
Often I have sent two or three men ashore to some town to converse with them, and 
the natives came out in great numbers, and as soon as they saw our men arrive, fled 
without a moment&#39;s delay although I protected them from all injury.</p>
<p>At every point where I landed, and succeeded in talking to them, I gave them 
some of everything I had — cloth and many other things — without receiving anything 
in return, but they are a hopelessly timid people. It is true that since they have 
gained more confidence and are losing this fear, they are so unsuspicious and so 
generous with what they possess, that no one who had not seen it would believe it. 
They never refuse anything that is asked for. They even offer it themselves, and 
show so much love that they would give their very hearts. Whether it be anything 
of great or small value, with any trifle of whatever kind, they are satisfied. I 
forbade worthless things being given to them, such as bits of broken bowls, pieces 
of glass, and old straps, although they were as much pleased to get them as if they 
were the finest jewels in the world. One sailor was found to have got for a leathern 
strap, gold of the weight of two and a half castellanos, and others for even more 
worthless things much more; while for a new blancas they would give all they had, 
were it two or three castellanos of pure gold or an arroba or two of spun cotton. 
Even bits of the broken hoops of wine casks they accepted, and gave in return what 
they had, like fools, and it seemed wrong to me. I forbade it, and gave a thousand 
good and pretty things that I had to win their love, and to induce them to become 
Christians, and to love and serve their Highnesses and the whole Castilian nation, 
and help to get for us things they have in abundance, which are necessary to us. 
They have no religion, nor idolatry, except that they all believe power and goodness 
to be in heaven. They firmly believed that I, with my ships and men, came from heaven, 
and with this idea I have been received everywhere, since they lost fear of me. 
They are, however, far from being ignorant. They are most ingenious men, and navigate 
these seas in a wonderful way, and describe everything well, but they never before 
saw people wearing clothes, nor vessels like ours. Directly I reached the Indies 
in the first isle I discovered, I took by force some of the natives, that from them 
we might gain some information of what there was in these parts; and so it was that 
we immediately understood each other, either by words or signs. They are still with 
me and still believe that I come from heaven. They were the first to declare this 
wherever I went, and the others ran from house to house, and to the towns around, 
crying out, &quot;Come ! come! and see the man from heaven!&quot; Then all, both men and women, 
as soon as they were reassured about us, came, both small and great, all bringing 
something to eat and to drink, which they presented with marvellous kindness. In 
these isles there are a great many canoes, something like rowing boats, of all sizes, 
and most of them are larger than an eighteen-oared galley. They are not so broad, 
as they are made of a single plank, but a galley could not keep up with them in 
rowing, because they go with incredible speed, and with these they row about among 
all these islands, which are innumerable, and carry on their commerce. I have seen 
some of these canoes with seventy and eighty men in them, and each had an oar. In 
all the islands I observed little difference in the appearance of the people, or 
in their habits and language, except that they understand each other, which is remarkable. 
Therefore I hope that their Highnesses will decide upon the conversion of these 
people to our holy faith, to which they seem much inclined. I have already stated 
how I sailed one hundred and seven leagues along the sea-coast of Juana, in a straight 
line from west to east. I can therefore assert that this island is larger than England 
and Scotland together, since beyond these one hundred and seven leagues there remained 
at the west point two provinces where I did not go, one of which they call Avan, 
the home of men with tails. These provinces are computed to be fifty or sixty leagues 
in length, as far as can be gathered from the Indians with me, who are acquainted 
with all these islands. This other, Hispaniola, is larger in circumference than 
all Spain from Catalonia to Fuentarabia in Biscay, since upon one of its four sides 
I sailed one hundred and eighty-eight leagues from west to east. This is worth having, 
and must on no account be given up. I have taken possession of all these islands, 
for their Highnesses, and all may be more extensive than I know, or can say, and 
I hold them for their Highnesses, who can command them as absolutely as the kingdoms 
of Castile. In Hispaniola, in the most convenient place, most accessible for the 
gold mines and all commerce with the mainland on this side or with that of the great 
Khan, on the other, with which there would be great trade and profit, I have taken 
possession of a large town, which I have named the City of Navidad. I began fortifications 
there which should be completed by this time, and I have left in it men enough to 
hold it, with arms, artillery, and provisions for more than a year; and a boat with 
a master seaman skilled in the arts necessary to make others; I am so friendly with 
the king of that country that he was proud to call me his brother and hold me as 
such. Even should he change his mind and wish to quarrel with my men, neither he 
nor his subjects know what arms are, nor wear clothes, as I have said. They are 
the most timid people in the world, so that only the men remaining there could destroy 
the whole region, and run no risk if they know how to behave themselves properly. 
In all these islands the men seem to be satisfied with one wife except they allow 
as many as twenty to their chief or men. The women appear to me to work harder than 
the men, and so far as I can hear they have nothing of their own, for I think I 
perceived that what one had others shared, especially food. In the islands so far, 
I have found no monsters, as some expected, but, on the contrary, they are people 
of very handsome appearance. They are not black as in Guinea, though their hair 
is straight and coarse, as it does not grow where the sun&#39;s rays are too ardent. 
And in truth the sun has extreme power here, since it is within twenty-six degrees 
of the equinoctial line. In these islands there are mountains where the cold this 
winter was very severe, but the people endure it from habit, and with the aid of 
the meat they eat with very hot spices.</p>
<p>As for monsters, I have found not trace of them except at the point in the second 
isle as one enters the Indies, which is inhabited by a people considered in all 
the isles as most ferocious, who eat human flesh. They possess many canoes, with 
which they overrun all the isles of India, stealing and seizing all they can. They 
are not worse looking than the others, except that they wear their hair long like 
women, and use bows and arrows of the same cane, with a sharp stick at the end for 
want of iron, of which they have none. They are ferocious compared to these other 
races, who are extremely cowardly; but I only hear this from the others. They are 
said to make treaties of marriage with the women in the first isle to be met with 
coming from Spain to the Indies, where there are no men. These women have no feminine 
occupation, but use bows and arrows of cane like those before mentioned, and cover 
and arm themselves with plates of copper, of which they have a great quantity. Another 
island, I am told, is larger than Hispaniola, where the natives have no hair, and 
where there is countless gold; and from them all I bring Indians to testify to this. 
To speak, in conclusion, only of what has been done during this hurried voyage, 
their Highnesses will see that I can give them as much gold as they desire, if they 
will give me a little assistance, spices, cotton, as much as their Highnesses may 
command to be shipped, and mastic as much as their Highnesses choose to send for, 
which until now has only been found in Greece, in the isle of Chios, and the Signoria 
can get its own price for it; as much lign-aloe as they command to be shipped, and 
as many slaves as they choose to send for, all heathens. I think I have found rhubarb 
and cinnamon. Many other things of value will be discovered by the men I left behind 
me, as I stayed nowhere when the wind allowed me to pursue my voyage, except in 
the City of Navidad, which I left fortified and safe. Indeed, I might have accomplished 
much more, had the crews served me as they ought to have done. The eternal and almighty 
God, our Lord, it is Who gives to all who walk in His way, victory over things apparently 
impossible, and in this case signally so, because although these lands had been 
imagined and talked of before they were seen, most men listened incredulously to 
what was thought to be but an idle tale. But our Redeemer has given victory to our 
most illustrious King and Queen, and to their kingdoms rendered famous by this glorious 
event, at which all Christendom should rejoice, celebrating it with great festivities 
and solemn Thanksgivings to the Holy Trinity, with fervent prayers for the high 
distinction that will accrue to them from turning so many peoples to our holy faith; 
and also from the temporal benefits that not only Spain but all Christian nations 
will obtain. Thus I record what has happened in a brief note written on board the
<i>Caravel</i>, off the Canary Isles, on the 15th of February, 1493.</p>
<p>Yours to command,<br>
THE ADMIRAL</p>
<p>Postscript within the letter<br>
Since writing the above, being in the Sea of Castile, so much wind arose south southeast, 
that I was forced to lighten the vessels, to run into this port of Lisbon to-day 
which was the most extraordinary thing in the world, from whence I resolved to write 
to their Highnesses. In all the Indies I always found the temperature like that 
of May. Where I went in thirty-three days I returned in twenty-eight, except that 
these gales have detained me fourteen days, knocking about in this sea, Here all 
seamen say that there has never been so rough a winter, nor so many vessels lost. 
Done the 14th day of March.</p>
<p>This letter Columbus sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, from the Islands 
discovered in the Indies, enclosed in another to their Highnesses.</p>
