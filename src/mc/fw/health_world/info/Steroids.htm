      <td width="100%">Kids dream of being professional athletes and why not? It&#39;s 
      fun to think about being the very best in your favorite sport, not to mention 
      earning a big salary. But in recent years, people have been looking more closely 
      at the way some athletes get their bodies into super shape - tough enough 
      to break records.<p>
      <img class="right" src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/Steroids/1.gif" align="right" width="195" height="315"></p>
      <p>Some athletes have admitted using steroids, which are artificial
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/word/h/word_hormones.html">hormones</a> 
      that can improve strength and muscle mass. Steroids are illegal and they can 
      cause serious health problems, but studies still show some kids, teens, and 
      adults are willing to try them. Let&#39;s talk about what steroids are, how they 
      can affect your body, and why it&#39;s a good idea to avoid them.</p>
      <h3>What Are Steroids?</h3>
      <p>&quot;Steroids&quot; has more than one meaning. Your body naturally produces some 
      steroids, to help you fight stress and grow bigger during
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuff/puberty.html">puberty</a>. 
      (But your body knows just the right amount that you need, so there&#39;s no need 
      to take any extra.) There&#39;s also a type of medicine called steroids that people 
      might take if they have pain,
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/asthma_basics/what/asthma.html">asthma</a>, 
      or a skin problem. But these aren&#39;t the kind of steroids getting attention 
      in sports.</p>
      <p>When people say steroids (say: <strong>stare</strong>-oydz), they often 
      mean illegal anabolic steroids. <strong>Anabolic steroids</strong> are artificially 
      produced hormones that are the same as, or similar to, androgens, the male-type 
      sex hormones in the body. The most powerful of these is <strong>testosterone</strong> 
      (say: tes-<strong>tos</strong>-tuh-rone). Anabolic steroids can be taken in 
      the form of pills, powders, or injections. Anabolic steroids are always illegal, 
      meaning that you could get arrested for buying, selling, or taking them.</p>
      <p>Some athletes take anabolic steroids because of their testosterone-like 
      effects, such as increasing
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/boy/getting_muscles.html">muscle mass</a> 
      and strength. This might sound like just a guy thing, but girls also have 
      used steroids to get stronger and change the way they look. And it&#39;s not only 
      professional athletes who have taken these illegal drugs. Investigations and 
      studies have shown that teens, college athletes, and others have taken steroids.</p>
      <p>There are <strong>supplements</strong> available that contain anabolic 
      steroids. You might see ads for these on the Internet or in the back of sports 
      or body building magazines.<strong> </strong>Some have been banned in the 
      United States while others are still legal. Legal or illegal, these supplements 
      can cause health problems. Kids should not take <strong>any</strong> steroid 
      supplement, even those that are still on the market.</p>
      <h3>Dangers of Steroids</h3>
      <p>Anabolic steroids cause many different types of problems. Less serious 
      side effects include
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuff/acne.html">acne</a>, oily 
      hair, purple or red spots on the body, swelling of the legs and feet, and 
      persistent bad breath. A kid or teen who takes steroids might not grow as 
      tall as he or she was supposed to grow. Some other serious and long-lasting 
      side effects are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>premature balding </li>
        <li>dizziness </li>
        <li>mood swings, including anger and
        <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/feeling/thought/sadness.html">sadness</a>&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>seeing or hearing things that aren&#39;t there (hallucinations) </li>
        <li>extreme feelings of mistrust or fear (paranoia) </li>
        <li>problems sleeping </li>
        <li>nausea </li>
        <li>vomiting </li>
        <li>trembling </li>
        <li>high blood pressure that can damage the heart or blood vessels over 
        time </li>
        <li>aching joints </li>
        <li>greater chance of injuring muscles and tendons </li>
        <li>jaundice or yellowing of the skin; liver damage </li>
        <li>trouble peeing </li>
        <li>increased risk of developing
        <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grownup/conditions/heart_disease.html">
        heart disease</a>,
        <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grownup/conditions/stroke.html">stroke</a>, 
        and some types of cancer </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These risks affect girls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>increased facial hair growth </li>
        <li>deeper voice, like a man&#39;s </li>
        <li>shrinking of the breasts </li>
        <li>
        <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/girlstuff/menstruation.html">period</a> 
        changes </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Specific risks for boys include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>shrinkage of the
        <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/boy/down_there.html">testicles and 
        penis problems</a> </li>
        <li>pain when urinating (peeing) </li>
        <li>breast development </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because steroids can be injected (given in a shot), users run the risk 
      of getting illnesses that can be passed through needles that are dirty, or 
      shared. These include HIV/AIDS and hepatitis, a serious liver disease. Though 
      some problems may show up right away, others may not appear for years. One 
      former Oakland Raiders lineman who died of brain cancer believed that steroid 
      use during his football career was one reason he got the disease.</p>
      <h3>Using Steroids Isn&#39;t Playing Fair</h3>
      <p>Your health is the No. 1 reason not to use steroids or a steroid supplement. 
      But there&#39;s another very important reason: It&#39;s just not fair. When people 
      use steroids, it gives them an unfair advantage against others who trained 
      and practiced without using illegal steroids.</p>
      <p>And because all levels of sports - from high school to the pros - are testing 
      athletes for steroid use, there&#39;s a growing chance the person will get caught. 
      If caught, he or she will face a lot of embarrassment and could be banned 
      from the sport.</p>
      <p>But maybe worst of all, any achievements the athlete made while on steroids 
      could be questioned. Someone might say, &quot;He didn&#39;t really deserve to be on 
      the All-Star team, he was on steroids.&quot; Or, &quot;She shouldn&#39;t have that trophy, 
      she was cheating.&quot; So win on your own power - without steroids. Then, you 
      can hang on to all your honors - and your health!</p>
