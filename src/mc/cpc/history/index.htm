</font>or thousands of years, humans have computed, recorded facts, communicated 
information, and expressed themselves. Ancient artifacts show evidence of computing 
and record keeping. Humans have<img border="0" src="../../../i/mc/cpc/Computer.gif" align="right" width="200" height="200"> 
talked with each other for so long that no one is exactly sure when and where talking 
began. The walls of the caves of Lascaux, France, and by many other sites are filled 
with drawings made by ancient peoples. No one is sure exactly what these drawings 
mean. However, one thing is certain: the ancient people were <i>expressing</i> themselves. 
No wonder, then, that Computers and the Internet, after all, let us compute, keep 
records, communicate, and express ourselves but in the ways that were never imagined.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early computing devices were used for computation. Computers 
also played an important role in World War II, where they were used to encode and 
decode messages. In the late 1960s, computer scientists discovered ways to make 
computers talk with each other. They began work on a network that scientists could 
use to communicate about their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1970s was an important decade in computers. In the early 
1970s, the first computer network was up and running. It linked about two dozen 
research centers. The first truly personal computer became available in the mid-1980s. 
This computer was called the Apple I. It was actually a kit that hobbyists could 
buy. You had to build it yourself! Later the Apple II was invented. It was a completely 
assembled computer. In the mid-1980s, Apple introduced the Macintosh, and IBM also 
introduced a personal computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in the 1980s government and university research laboratories 
formed the ARPANET. While this system provided the conceptual basis for the Internet, 
the ARPANET was not available to the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The early 1990s saw the introduction of computer networks 
to the public. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, people from all 
over the world can travel the information super-highway. As of this writing, the 
World Wide Web contains over 70,000,000 web sites, and the number is growing.</p>
