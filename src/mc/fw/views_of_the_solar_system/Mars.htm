<!-- INBODYEND -->Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is commonly referred 
to as the Red Planet. The rocks, soil and sky have a red or pink hue. The distinct 
red color was observed by stargazers throughout history. It was given its name by 
the Romans in honor of their god of war. Other civilizations have had similar names. 
The ancient Egyptians named the planet <i>Her Descher</i> meaning <i>the red one</i>.
<p>Before space exploration, Mars was considered the best candidate for harboring 
extraterrestrial life. Astronomers thought they saw straight lines crisscrossing 
its surface. This led to the popular belief that irrigation canals on the planet 
had been constructed by intelligent beings. In 1938, when Orson Welles broadcasted 
a radio drama based on the science fiction classic <i>War of the Worlds</i> by H.G. 
Wells, enough people believed in the tale of invading Martians to cause a near panic.
</p>
<p>Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to do with the apparent 
seasonal color changes on the planet&#39;s surface. This phenomenon led to speculation 
that conditions might support a bloom of Martian vegetation during the warmer months 
and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods. </p>
<p>In July of 1965, <a HREF="marin4.htm">Mariner 4</a>, transmitted 22 close-up 
pictures of Mars. All that was revealed was a surface containing many craters and 
naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water. 
Finally, in July and September 1976, <a HREF="viking.htm">Viking</a> Landers 1 and 
2 touched down on the surface of Mars. The three biology experiments aboard the 
landers discovered unexpected and enigmatic chemical activity in the Martian soil, 
but provided no clear evidence for the presence of living microorganisms in the 
soil near the landing sites. According to mission biologists, Mars is self-sterilizing. 
They believe the combination of solar ultraviolet <a HREF="terms.htm#radiation">
radiation</a> that saturates the surface, the extreme dryness of the soil and the 
oxidizing nature of the soil chemistry prevent the formation of living organisms 
in the Martian soil. The question of life on Mars at some time in the distant past 
remains open. </p>
<p>Other instruments found no sign of organic chemistry at either landing site, 
but they did provide a precise and definitive analysis of the composition of the 
Martian atmosphere and found previously undetected trace elements. </p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of Mars is quite different from that of Earth. It is composed 
primarily of carbon dioxide with small amounts of other gases. The six most common 
components of the atmosphere are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Carbon Dioxide (CO2): 95.32% </li>
  <li>Nitrogen (N2): 2.7% </li>
  <li>Argon (Ar): 1.6% </li>
  <li>Oxygen (O2): 0.13% </li>
  <li>Water (H2O): 0.03% </li>
  <li>Neon (Ne): 0.00025 % </li>
</ul>
<p>Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much water as our air, but even this 
small amount can condense out, forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or 
swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning fog 
can form in valleys. At the Viking Lander 2 site, a thin layer of water frost covered 
the ground each winter. </p>
<p>There is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed 
water to flow on the planet. Physical features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, 
riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet. </p>
<h3>Temperature and Pressure</h3>
<p>The average recorded temperature on Mars is -63° C (-81° F) with a maximum temperature 
of 20° C (68° F) and a minimum of -140° C (-220° F). </p>
<p>Barometric pressure varies at each landing site on a semiannual basis. Carbon 
dioxide, the major constituent of the atmosphere, freezes out to form an immense 
polar cap, alternately at each pole. The carbon dioxide forms a great cover of snow 
and then evaporates again with the coming of spring in each hemisphere. When the 
southern cap was largest, the mean daily pressure observed by Viking Lander 1 was 
as low as 6.8 millibars; at other times of the year it was as high as 9.0 millibars. 
The pressures at the Viking Lander 2 site were 7.3 and 10.8 millibars. In comparison, 
the average pressure of the Earth is 1000 millibars. </p>

This image is a large mosaic of the Valles Marineris [VAL-less mar-uh-NAIR-iss] 
hemisphere of Mars. It is a view similar to that which one would see from a spacecraft. 
The lower center of the scene shows the entire Valles Marineris canyon system, more 
than 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles) long and up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) deep, 
extending from Noctis Labyrinthus, the arcuate system of graben to the west, to 
the chaotic terrain to the east. Many huge ancient river channels begin from the 
chaotic terrain and north-central canyons and run north. Many of the channels flowed 
into a basin called Acidalia Planitia, which is the dark area in the extreme north 
of this picture. The three Tharsis volcanoes (dark red spots), each about 25 kilometers 
(16 miles) high, are visible to the west along with Olympus Mons the largest volcano 
on the planet. Very ancient terrain covered by many impact craters lies to the south 
of Valles Marineris. The polar cap can be seen to the north. <i>(Copyright Calvin

<a HREF="../cap/mars/marsint.htm" class="ct">The Interior of Mars</a> <br>
The current understanding of the interior of Mars suggests that it can be modeled 
with a thin crust, similar to Earth&#39;s, a mantle and a core. Using four parameters, 
the Martian core size and mass can be determined. However, only three out of the 
four are known and include the total mass, size of Mars, and the moment of inertia. 
Mass and size was determined accurately from early missions. The moment of inertia 
was determined from Viking lander and Pathfinder Doppler data, by measuring the 
precession rate of Mars. The fourth parameter, needed to complete the interior model, 
will be obtained from future spacecraft missions. With the three known parameters, 
the model is significantly constrained. If the Martian core is dense (composed of 
iron) similar to Earth&#39;s or SNC meteorites thought to originate from Mars, then 
the minimum core radius would be about 1300 kilometers. If the core is made out 
of less-dense material such as a mixture of sulfur and iron, the maximum radius 
would probably be less than 2000 kilometers. <i>(Copyright 1998 by Calvin J. Hamilton)</i>

on Mars is about 19 miles (30 kilometers), one and a half times the range of elevations 
found on Earth, The most curious aspect of the map is the striking difference between 
the planet&#39;s low, smooth Northern Hemisphere and the heavily cratered Southern Hemisphere,&quot; 
which sits, on average, about three miles (five kilometers) higher than the north.

Ophir Chasma is a large west-northwest-trending trough about 100 km wide. The Chasma 
is bordered by 4 km high walled cliffs, most likely faults, that show spur-and-gully 
morphology and smooth sections. The walls have been dissected by landslides forming 
reentrants; one area (upper left) on the north wall shows a young landslide about 
100 km wide. The volume of the landslide debris is more than 1000 times greater 
than that from the May 18, 1980 debris avalanche from Mount St. Helens. The longitudinal 
grooves seen in the foreground are thought to be due to differential shear and lateral 
spreading at high velocities. The landslide passes between mounds of interior layered 
deposits on the floor of the chasma. <i>(Courtesy USGS)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Landslide in Valles Marineris</b> <br>
Although Valles Marineris originated as a tectonic structure, it has been modified 
by other processes. This image shows a close-up view of a landslide on the south 
wall of Valles Marineris. This landslide partially removed the rim of the crater 
that is on the plateau adjacent to Valles Marineris. Note the texture of the landslide 
deposit where it flowed across the floor of Valles Marineris. Several distinct layers 
can be seen in the walls of the trough. These layers may be regions of distinct 
chemical composition or mechanical properties in the Martian crust. <i>(Copyright

<b>HST 3 Views of Mars at Opposition</b> <br>
These Hubble Space Telescope views provide the most detailed complete global coverage 
of the Red Planet ever seen from Earth. The pictures were taken on February 25, 
1995, when Mars was at a distance of 103 million kilometers (65 million miles). 
To the surprise of researchers, Mars is cloudier than seen in previous years. This 
means the planet is cooler and drier, because water vapor in the atmosphere freezes 
out to form ice-crystal clouds. The three images show the Tharsis, Valles Marineris 
and Syrtis Major regions. <i>(Credit: Philip James, University of Toledo; Steven

<b>Outflow Source of Channel Ravi Vallis</b> <br>
This image of the head of Ravi Vallis shows a 300-kilometer (186-mile) long portion 
of a channel. Like many other channels that empty into the northern plains of Mars, 
Ravi Vallis orginates in a region of collapsed and disrupted (&quot;chaotic&quot;) terrain 
within the planet&#39;s older, cratered highlands. Structures in these channels indicate 
that they were carved by liquid water moving at high flow rates. The abrupt beginning 
of the channel, with no apparent tributaries, suggests that the water was released 
under great pressure from beneath a confining layer of frozen ground. As this water 
was released and flowed away, the overlying surface collapsed, producing the disruption 
and subsidence shown here. Three such regions of chaotic collapsed material are 
seen in this image, connected by a channel whose floor was scoured by the flowing 
water. The flow in this channel was from west to east (left to right). This channel 
ultimately links up with a system of channels that flowed northward into Chryse 
Basin. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton; Caption: LPI)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

<b>Streamlined Islands</b> <br>
The water that carved the channels to the north and east of the Valles Marineris 
canyon system had tremendous erosive power. One consequence of this erosion was 
the formation of streamlined islands where the water encountered obstacles along 
its path. This image shows two streamlined islands that formed as the water was 
diverted by two 8-10 kilometer (5-6 mile) diameter craters lying near the mouth 
of Ares Vallis in Chryse Planitia. The water flowed from south to north (bottom 
to top of the image). The height of the scarp surrounding the upper island is about 
400 meters (1,300 feet), while the scarp surrounding the southern island is about 
600 meters (2,000 feet) high. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton; Caption: LPI)</i>

<b>Valley Network</b> <br>
Unlike the features shown in the above two images, many systems on Mars do not show 
evidence of catastrophic flooding. Instead, they show a resemblance to drainage 
systems on Earth, where water acts at slow rates over long periods of time. As on 
Earth, the channels shown here merge together to form larger channels. </p>
<p>However, these valley networks are less developed than typical terrestrial drainage 
systems, with the Martian examples lacking small-scale streams feeding into the 
larger valleys. Because of the absence of small-scale streams in the Martian valley 
networks, it is thought that the valleys were carved primarily by ground water flow 
rather than by runoff of rain. Although liquid water is currently unstable on the 
surface of Mars, theoretical studies indicate that flowing groundwater might be 
able to form valley networks if the water flowed beneath a protective cover of ice. 
Alternatively, because the valley networks are confined to relatively old regions 
of Mars, their presence may indicate that Mars once possessed a warmer and wetter 
climate in its early history. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton; Caption: LPI)</i>

<b>Polar Laminated Terrain</b> <br>
One of the discoveries of the Mariner 9 spacecraft was that the south polar cap 
of Mars was made of thin layers or laminations of ice and sediment. Four years later, 
on October 10, 1976, the Viking 2 spacecraft took this picture of the Martian north 
polar cap. The visible layering occurred as a result of wind born dust settling 
upon the polar cap. As the caps experience climatic variations, they expand and 
contract. The layers of dust sediment tend to grow thicker near the poles where 
ice deposits remain for longer periods of time. The thickness of the deposits indicates 
they were formed during cyclical climatic variation rather than annual changes. 
As ice withdraws from a region, wind exposes the layers sculpting valleys and scarps. 
The formation of layered deposits is an active process today. <i>(Copyright 1998

This thumnail image shows a section of transverse dunes. The full image has a field 
of traverse dunes on the left and barchan dunes on the right with a transition zone 
inbetween. Transverse dunes are oriented perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. 
They are long and linear, and frequently join their neighbor in a low-angle &quot;Y&quot; 
junction. Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds with downwind-pointing horns. 
These dunes are comparable in size to the largest dunes found on the Earth. <i>(Copyright

<b>Local Dust Storm</b> <br>
Local dust storms are relatively common on Mars. They tend to occur in areas of 
high topographic and/or high thermal gradients (usually near the polar caps), where 
surface winds would be strongest. This storm is several hundreds of kilometers in 
extent and is located near the edge of the south polar cap. Some local storms grow 
larger, others die out. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton; caption by LPI)</i>
