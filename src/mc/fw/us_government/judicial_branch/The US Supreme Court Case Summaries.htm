  </b>A six-foot monument displaying the Ten Commandments donated by a private group

  <ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">United States</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION></ST1:PLACE></b></em><strong> 
  (1879)</strong> <br>
  A federal law banning polygamy was upheld. The Free Exercise Clause forbids government 
  from regulating belief, but does allow government to regulate actions such as 
  marriage. </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Minersville v. Gobitas</b></em><strong> (1940)</strong>
  <br>
  The Court upheld a
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">
  <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Pennsylvania</ST1:STATE></ST1:PLACE> flag-salute law, because 
  “religious liberty must give way to political authority.” This was reversed in
  <em>West Virginia v. Barnette</em> (1943). </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Cantwell v.
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">
  <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Connecticut</ST1:STATE></ST1:PLACE></b></em><strong> (1940)</strong>
  <br>
  States could not require special permits for religious solicitation when permits 
  were not required for non-religious solicitation. The Court began applying the 
  Free Exercise Clause to the states and recognized an absolute freedom of belief.
  </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Braunfeld v. Brown</b></em><strong> (1961)</strong>
  <br>
  The Court upheld a
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">
  <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Pennsylvania</ST1:STATE></ST1:PLACE> law requiring stores 
  to be closed on Sundays, even though Orthodox Jews claimed the law unduly burdened 
  them since their religion required them to close their stores on Saturdays as 
  well. The Court held that the law did not target Jews specifically as a group.
  </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><strong><i>Sh</i></strong><em><b>erbert v. Verner </b>
  </em><strong>(1963)</strong> <br>
  The Court ruled that states could not deny unemployment benefits to a person for 
  turning down a job because it required him/her to work on the Sabbath. Requiring 
  a person to abandon their religious convictions in order to receive benefits was 
  a violation of the Free Exercise Clause. </p>

  <ST1:STATE w:st="on"><strong><i>W</i></strong><em><b>isconsin</b></em></ST1:STATE></ST1:PLACE><em><b> 
  v. Yoder</b></em><strong> (1972)</strong> <br>
  The Court ruled that Amish adolescents could be exempt from a state law requiring 
  school attendance for all 14- to 16-year-olds, since their religion required living 
  apart from the world and worldly influence. The state’s interest in students’ 
  attending two more years of school was not enough to outweigh the individual right 
  to free exercise. </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>McDaniel v. Paty</b></em><strong> (1978)</strong>
  <br>
  A Tennessee law barring members of the clergy from public office was overturned 
  because it directly targeted people because of their religious profession. </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Thornton v. Caldor </b></em><strong>(1985)</strong>
  <br>
  Private companies are free to fire people who refuse to work on any day they claim 
  is their Sabbath, because the First Amendment applies only to government, not 
  to private employers </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Goldman v. Weinberger</b></em><strong> (1986)</strong>
  <br>
  Air Force penalties against a Jewish chaplain who wore a yarmulke (skull cap) 
  on duty in defiance of regulations were upheld. The military’s interest in uniformity 
  outweighed the individual right to free exercise. </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Employment Division v. Smith</b></em><strong> (1990)</strong>
  <br>
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">
  <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Oregon</ST1:STATE></ST1:PLACE> could deny unemployment benefits 
  to someone fired from a job for illegally smoking peyote during a religious ceremony. 
  The Free Exercise Clause does not excuse people from obeying the law. </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><em><b>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of
  <ST1:CITY w:st="on">Hialeah</ST1:CITY></b></em><strong> (1993)</strong> <br>
  Laws passed by four
  <ST1:PLACE w:st="on">
  <ST1:STATE w:st="on">Florida</ST1:STATE></ST1:PLACE> cities banning animal sacrifice 
  were targeted at the Santeria religion, which employs animal sacrifice in prayer, 
  and therefore the laws were unconstitutional. </p>
  <p class="pQuickPlace"><strong><i>Locke v. Davey </i>(2004)</strong><b><i><br>
  </i></b>States could refuse to award scholarship funds to college students pursuing 
  divinity degrees in preparation for the ministry. The denial of government funding

  The Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable searches applies to those conducted by
