<!-- INBODYEND -->Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the largest one 
in the solar system. If Jupiter were hollow, more than one thousand Earths could 
fit inside. It also contains more matter than all of the other planets combined. 
It has a mass of 1.9 x 10<sup>27</sup> kg and is 142,800 kilometers (88,736 miles) 
across the equator. Jupiter possesses 28 known satellites, four of which - Callisto, 
Europa, Ganymede and Io - were observed by <a HREF="People%20In%20Astronomy.htm#galileo">Galileo</a> 
as long ago as 1610. Another 12 satellites have been recently discovered and given 
provisional designators until they are officially confirmed and named. There is 
a ring system, but it is very faint and is totally invisible from the Earth. (The 
rings were discovered in 1979 by Voyager 1.) The atmosphere is very deep, perhaps 
comprising the whole planet, and is somewhat like the Sun. It is composed mainly 
of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane, ammonia, water vapor and 
other compounds. At great depths within Jupiter, the pressure is so great that the 
hydrogen atoms are broken up and the electrons are freed so that the resulting atoms 
consist of bare protons. This produces a state in which the hydrogen becomes metallic.
<p>Colorful latitudinal bands, atmospheric clouds and storms illustrate Jupiter&#39;s 
dynamic weather systems. The cloud patterns change within hours or days. The
<a HREF="#redspot">Great Red Spot</a> is a complex storm moving in a counter-clockwise 
direction. At the outer edge, material appears to rotate in four to six days; near 
the center, motions are small and nearly random in direction. An array of other 
smaller storms and eddies can be found through out the banded clouds. </p>
<p><a HREF="terms.htm#aurora">Auroral</a> emissions, similar to Earth&#39;s
<a HREF="terms.htm#aurorabor">northern lights</a>, were observed in the polar regions 
of Jupiter. The auroral emissions appear to be related to material from
<a HREF="io.htm">Io</a> that spirals along magnetic field lines to fall into Jupiter&#39;s 
atmosphere. Cloud-top lightning bolts, similar to superbolts in Earth&#39;s high atmosphere, 
were also observed. </p>
<h3>Jupiter&#39;s Ring</h3>
<p>Unlike Saturn&#39;s intricate and complex ring patterns, Jupiter has a simple ring 
system that is composed of an inner halo, a main ring and a Gossamer ring. To the 
Voyager spacecraft, the Gossamer ring appeared to be a single ring, but Galileo 
imagery provided the unexpected discovery that Gossamer is really two rings. One 
ring is embedded within the other. The rings are very tenuous and are composed of 
dust particles kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into Jupiter&#39;s four 
small inner moons <a HREF="metis.htm">Metis</a>, <a HREF="adrastea.htm">Adrastea</a>,
<a HREF="thebe.htm">Thebe</a>, and <a HREF="amalthea.htm">Amalthea</a>. Many of 
the particles are microscopic in size. </p>
<p>The innermost halo ring is toroidal in shape and extends radially from about 
92,000 kilometers (57,000 miles) to about 122,500 kilometers (76,000 miles) from 
Jupiter&#39;s center. It is formed as fine particles of dust from the main ring&#39;s inner 
boundary &#39;bloom&#39; outward as they fall toward the planet. The main and brightest 
ring extends from the halo boundary out to about 128,940 kilometers (80,000 miles) 
or just inside the orbit of Adrastea. Close to the orbit of Metis, the main ring&#39;s 
brightness decreases. </p>
<p>The two faint Gossamer rings are fairly uniform in nature. The innermost Amalthea 
Gossamer ring extends from the orbit of Adrastea out to the orbit of Amalthea at 
181,000 kilometers (112,000 miles) from Jupiter&#39;s center. The fainter Thebe Gossamer 
ring extends from Amalthea&#39;s orbit out to about Thebe&#39;s orbit at 221,000 kilometers 
(136,000 miles). </p>
<p>Jupiter&#39;s rings and moons exist within an intense radiation belt of electrons 
and ions trapped in the planet&#39;s magnetic field. These particles and fields comprise 
the jovian <a HREF="terms.htm#magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a> or magnetic environment, 
which extends 3 to 7 million kilometers (1.9 to 4.3 million miles) toward the Sun, 
and stretches in a windsock shape at least as far as Saturn&#39;s orbit - a distance 
of 750 million kilometers (466 million miles). <a NAME="stats"></a></p>

This image was taken by NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope on February 13, 1995. The 
image provides a detailed look at a unique cluster of three white oval-shaped storms 
that lie southwest (below and to the left) of Jupiter&#39;s Great Red Spot. The appearance 
of the clouds, in this image, is considerably different from their appearance only 
seven months earlier. These features are moving closer together as the Great Red 
Spot is carried westward by the prevailing winds while the white ovals are swept 
eastward. </p>
<p>The outer two of the white storms formed in the late 1930s. In the centers of 
these cloud systems the air is rising, carrying fresh ammonia gas upward. New, white 
ice crystals form when the upwelling gas freezes as it reaches the chilly cloud 
top level where temperatures are -130°C (-200°F). The intervening white storm center, 
the ropy structure to the left of the ovals, and the small brown spot have formed 
in low pressure cells. The white clouds sit above locations where gas is descending 
to lower, warmer regions. <br CLEAR="ALL">

<a href="../cap/pia/PIA04866.htm" class="ct">Cassini Jupiter Portrait</a> <br>
</p>
<p>This true color mosaic of Jupiter was constructed from images taken by the Cassini 
spacecraft on December 29, 2000, during its closest approach to the giant planet 
at a distance of approximately 10 million kilometers (6.2 million miles). </p>
<p>It is the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter ever produced; the smallest 
visible features are approximately 60 kilometers (37 miles) across. The mosaic is 
composed of 27 images: nine images were required to cover the entire planet in a 
tic-tac-toe pattern, and each of those locations was imaged in red, green, and blue 
to provide true color. Although Cassini&#39;s camera can see more colors than humans 
can, Jupiter&#39;s colors in this new view look very close to the way the human eye 
would see them. </p>
<p>Everything visible on the planet is a cloud. The parallel reddish-brown and white 
bands, the white ovals, and the large Great Red Spot persist over many years despite 
the intense turbulence visible in the atmosphere. The most energetic features are 
the small, bright clouds to the left of the Great Red Spot and in similar locations 
in the northern half of the planet. These clouds grow and disappear over a few days 
and generate lightning. Streaks form as clouds are sheared apart by Jupiter&#39;s intense 
jet streams that run parallel to the colored bands. The prominent dark band in the 
northern half of the planet is the location of Jupiter&#39;s fastest jet stream, with 
eastward winds of 480 kilometers (300 miles) per hour. Jupiter&#39;s diameter is eleven 
times that of Earth, so the smallest storms on this mosaic are comparable in size 
to the largest hurricanes on Earth. </p>
<p>Unlike Earth, where only water condenses to form clouds, Jupiter&#39;s clouds are 
made of ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water. The updrafts and downdrafts bring 
different mixtures of these substances up from below, leading to clouds at different 
heights. The brown and orange colors may be due to trace chemicals dredged up from 
deeper levels of the atmosphere, or they may be byproducts of chemical reactions 
driven by ultraviolet light from the Sun. Bluish areas, such as the small features 
just north and south of the equator, are areas of reduced cloud cover, where one 
can see deeper. <i>(Courtesy NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute)</i>

<a href="../cap/jup/jupint.htm" class="ct">The Interior of Jupiter</a> <br>
This picture illustrates the internal structure of Jupiter. The outer layer is primarily 
composed of molecular hydrogen. At greater depths the hydrogen starts resembling 
a liquid. At 10,000 kilometers below Jupiter&#39;s cloud top liquid hydrogen reaches 
a pressure of 1,000,000 bar with a temperature of 6,000° K. At this state hydrogen 
changes into a phase of liquid metallic hydrogen. In this state, the hydrogen atoms 
break down yeilding ionized protons and electrons similar to the Sun&#39;s interior. 
Below this is a layer dominated by ice where &quot;ice&quot; denotes a soupy liquid mixture 
of water, methane, and ammonia under high temperatures and pressures. Finally at 
the center is a rocky or rocky-ice core of up to 10 Earth masses. <i>(Copyright

Aurora</a> <br>
In this Hubble Space Telescope picture, a curtain of glowing gas is wrapped around 
Jupiter&#39;s north pole like a lasso. This curtain of light, called an aurora, is produced 
when high-energy electrons race along the planet&#39;s magnetic field and into the upper 
atmosphere where they excite atmospheric gases, causing them to glow. The aurora 
resembles the same phenomenon that crowns Earth&#39;s polar regions. But this Hubble 
image, taken in ultraviolet light, also shows the glowing &quot;footprints&quot; of three 
of Jupiter&#39;s largest moons: Io, Ganymede, and Europa. </p>

This image taken by the ion and neutral mass spectrometer instrument on NASA&#39;s Cassini 
spacecraft makes the huge magnetosphere surrounding Jupiter visible in a way no 
instrument on any previous spacecraft has been able to do. The magnetosphere is 
a bubble of charged particles trapped within the magnetic environment of the planet. 
A magnetic field is sketched over the image to place the energetic neutral atom 
emissions in perspective. This sketch extends in the horizontal plane to a width 
30 times the radius of Jupiter. Also shown for scale and location are the disk of 
Jupiter (black circle) and the approximate position (yellow circles) of the doughnut-shaped 
torus created from material spewed out by volcanoes on <a href="io.htm">Io</a>.
</p>
<p>Some of the fast-moving ions within the magnetosphere pick up electrons to become 
neutral atoms, and once they become neutral, they can escape Jupiter&#39;s magnetic 
field, flying out from the magnetosphere at speeds of thousands of kilometers, or 
miles, per second. <br CLEAR="ALL">

<a HREF="io.htm">Io</a>. The top panel pinpoints the effects of emissions from Io. 
The image on the left, shows how Io and Jupiter are linked by an invisible electrical 
current of charged particles called a <i>flux tube.</i> The particles, ejected from 
Io by volcanic eruptions, flow along Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field lines, which thread 
through Io, to the planet&#39;s north and south magnetic poles. </p>
<p>The top-right image shows Jupiter&#39;s auroral emissions at the north and south 
poles. Just outside these emissions are the auroral spots called &quot;footprints.&quot; The 
spots are created when the particles in Io&#39;s &quot;flux tube&quot; reach Jupiter&#39;s upper atmosphere 
and interact with hydrogen gas, making it fluoresce. </p>
<p>The two ultraviolet images at the bottom of the picture show how the auroral 
emissions change in brightness and structure as Jupiter rotates. These false-color 
images also reveal how the magnetic field is offset from Jupiter&#39;s spin axis by 
10 to 15 degrees. In the right image, the north auroral emission is rising over 
the left limb; the south auroral oval is beginning to set. The image on the left, 
obtained on a different date, shows a full view of the north aurora, with a strong 
emission inside the main auroral oval. </p>

<br>
This image is a false color representation of Jupiter&#39;s Great Red Spot taken with 
Galileo&#39;s imaging system through three different near-infrared filters. This is 
a mosaic of eighteen images (6 in each filter) that were taken over a period of 
6 minutes on June 26, 1996. The Great Red Spot appears pink and the surrounding 
region blue because of the particular color coding used in this representation. 
The red channel is the reflectance of Jupiter at a wavelength where methane strongly 
absorbs (889nm). Because of this absorption, only high clouds can reflect sunlight 
in this wavelength. The green channel is the reflectance in a wavelength where methane 
absorbs, but less strongly (727nm). Lower clouds can reflect sunlight in this wavelength. 
Finally, the blue channel is the reflectance in a wavelength where there are essentially 
no absorbers in the Jovian atmosphere (756nm) and one sees light reflected from 
the deepest clouds. Thus, the color of a cloud in this image indicates its height, 
with red or white being highest and blue or black being lowest. This image shows 
the Great Red Spot to be relatively high, as are some smaller clouds to the northeast 
and northwest that are surprisingly like towering thunderstorms found on earth. 
The deepest clouds are in the collar surrounding the Great Red Spot, and also just 
to the northwest of the high (bright) cloud in the northwest corner of the image. 
Preliminary modelling shows these cloud heights to range about 50km in altitude.

<p>Nearly four centuries ago Galileo Galilei turned his homemade telescope towards 
the heavens and discovered three points of light, which at first he thought to be 
stars, hugging the planet Jupiter. These stars were arranged in a straight line 
with Jupiter. Sparking his interest, Galileo observed the stars and found that they 
moved the wrong way. Four days later another star appeared. After observing the 
stars over the next few weeks, Galileo concluded that they were not stars but planetary 
bodies in orbit around Jupiter. These four stars have come to be know as the
<a HREF="galdisc.htm">Galilean satellites</a>. </p>
<p>Over the course of the following centuries another 12 moons were discovered bringing 
the total to 16. Another 12 satellites have been recently discovered and given provisional 
designators until they are officially confirmed and named. Finally in 1979, the 
strangeness of these frozen new worlds was brought to light by the Voyager spacecrafts 
as they swept past the Jovian system. Again in 1996, the exploration of these worlds 
took a large step forward as the Galileo spacecraft began its long term mission 
of observing Jupiter and its moons. </p>
<p>Twelve of Jupiter&#39;s moons are relatively small and seem to have been more likely 
captured than to have been formed in orbit around Jupiter. The four large Galilean 
moons, <a HREF="io.htm">Io,</a> <a HREF="europa.htm">Europa,</a>
<a HREF="ganymede.htm">Ganymede</a> and <a HREF="callisto.htm">Callisto,</a> are 
believed to have <a HREF="terms.htm#accretion">accreted</a> as part of the process 
by which Jupiter itself formed. The following table summarizes the radius, mass, 
distance from the planet center, discoverer and the date of discovery of each of 
the moons of Jupiter: </p>
