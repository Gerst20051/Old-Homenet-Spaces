            <p><b>What is Transient Ischemic Attack?<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p>A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a transient stroke that lasts only 
            a few minutes. It occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain 
            is briefly interrupted. TIA symptoms, which usually occur suddenly, 
            are similar to those of stroke but do not last as long. Most symptoms 
            of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may persist for up 
            to 24 hours. Symptoms can include: numbness or weakness in the face, 
            arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; confusion or difficulty 
            in talking or understanding speech; trouble seeing in one or both eyes; 
            and difficulty with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance and coordination.

              Because there is no way to tell whether symptoms are from a TIA or 
              an acute stroke, patients should assume that all stroke-like symptoms 
              signal an emergency and should not wait to see if they go away. A 
              prompt evaluation (within 60 minutes) is necessary to identify the 
              cause of the TIA and determine appropriate therapy. Depending on a 
              patient&#39;s medical history and the results of a medical examination, 
              the doctor may recommend drug therapy or surgery to reduce the risk 
              of stroke in people who have had a TIA. The use of antiplatelet agents, 
              particularly aspirin, is a standard treatment for patients at risk 
              for stroke. People with atrial fibrillation (irregular beating of 
              the heart) may be prescribed anticoagulants.

              TIAs are often warning signs that a person is at risk for a more serious 
              and debilitating stroke. About one-third of those who have a TIA will 
              have an acute stroke some time in the future. Many strokes can be 
              prevented by heeding the warning signs of TIAs and treating underlying 
              risk factors. The most important treatable factors linked to TIAs 
              and stroke are high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, heart disease, 
              carotid artery disease, diabetes, and heavy use of alcohol. Medical 
              help is available to reduce and eliminate these factors. Lifestyle 
              changes such as eating a balanced diet, maintaining healthy weight, 
              exercising, and enrolling in smoking and alcohol cessation programs 
              can also reduce these factors.
