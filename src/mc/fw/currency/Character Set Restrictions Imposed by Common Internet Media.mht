Media</H1>
<P align=3Dcenter>Last updated: 10-May-2003</P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>There are three main Internet media in which almost =
any=20
Internet user can author content: <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#email">E-mail<=
/A>, <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#news">News</A>=
 and the=20
<A href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#www">World =
Wide=20
Web</A>. Each of these media has restrictions (largely arising from =
historical=20
circumstance) on the characters that may be used. These restrictions are =

arbitrary, difficult to remember and sometimes appear petty, but =
ignoring them=20
will cause problems for others and possibly yourself.=20
<P>The situation is made worse by the fact that many modern applications =
dealing=20
with these media are written by people who are unaware of, do not =
understand or=20
(worse) deliberately ignore Internet standards and conventions. One of =
the worst=20
offenders in this regard ironically claims that the Internet was =
designed to be=20
compatible with its software (even though users of its products are =
regularly=20
lambasted for using "broken" software that ignores and breaks most =
Internet=20
standards and conventions).=20
<H2>History</H2>The Internet was developed in the US back in the days =
when only=20
7-bit character sets (a 7-bit character set can contain up to&nbsp;128=20
characters) were in use and 8-bit character sets (which can contain up=20
to&nbsp;256 characters) were unheard of.=20
<P>Although the Internet transmits information in 8-bit chunks, since =
there were=20
no 8-bit character sets around at the time, the designers of the =
Internet had to=20
choose one of the many 7-bit character sets in use around the world as =
the=20
standard character set for many protocols. The natural decision (since =
they were=20
in the US) was to use US ASCII (ISO&nbsp;646-US) as the standard =
character set=20
for these protocols (such as e-mail and later news).=20
<H2>Why You Should Follow the Rules</H2>The Internet adopts change =
slowly.=20
Although it is possible to extend protocol definitions in ways which are =

backwards-compatible (so people using old software can continue to use =
that=20
software to send data), this can cause problems for older software when=20
receiving data which makes use of the extensions. As long as anyone on =
the=20
Internet is using older software, it is unwise to make use of protocol=20
extensions. On the Internet, old software doesn't die, it simply fades =
away (but=20
<EM>very</EM> slowly).=20
<P>The rules presented here define what it is possible to do and still =
be=20
certain that you will not cause problems for others. In some cases you =
can break=20
the rules without any apparent problem (it may cause problems for some =
but if=20
they don't complain you won't know about it) in the same way that you =
can often=20
break the speed limit and not get caught. Just like breaking the speed =
limit,=20
just because you have managed to get away with it several times that =
does not=20
mean that it is a good idea to do so.=20
<P>Some people don't particularly care that they may cause problems for =
others.=20
In news posts a common attitude is that if 90% (or 75%, or whatever) of =
people=20
can read their posts then that is good enough. This is a very selfish =
attitude=20
if you have something to say that others would like to read and a very =
foolish=20
attitude if you are requesting help (it is possible that the only person =
with=20
the answer is one of those you have excluded by posting something he =
can't=20
read). In practise you'll find that if you break the rules a large =
proportion of=20
those with long experience of the Internet will ignore your posts =
whether they=20
can read them or not on the principle that if you're so selfish or =
foolish as to=20
exclude those with older software your posts have nothing worthwhile to =
offer=20
anyway.=20
<P>It takes a little more effort to follow the rules, but if you have =
something=20
to say you surely wish as many people as possible to read it. If not, =
why bother=20
in the first place?=20
<H2>Valid ASCII Characters</H2>ASCII (ISO 646-US) is the character set =
used by=20
e-mail and news. Valid (printable) characters are:=20

<P>Also valid are the space character and the tab character.=20
<P>You should not explicitly use the carriage-return or line-feed =

(carriage-return followed by line-feed). The effect of inserting an =

carriage-return or line-feed (whichever of them happens not to be used =
to=20
indicate new lines on your computer) is unpredictable.=20
<H2><A name=3Diso8859/1>Valid ISO 8859/1 Characters</A></H2>ISO 8859/1 =

<P>Also valid are the space character, the tab character, the hard space =
and the=20
soft hyphen. The hard space character (character code 160&nbsp;decimal) =
is=20
identical in appearance to the ordinary space but applications which=20
automatically format text should not break a line at a hard space. The =
soft=20
hyphen (character code 173&nbsp;decimal) should be discarded by all =
applications=20
unless they automatically format text, in which case it indicates a =
suitable=20
point to break a line and display a hyphen (many applications either =
fail to=20
discard the soft hyphen when they should or fail to treat it as a =
potential=20
break point).=20
<P>You should not explicitly use the carriage-return or line-feed =
control=20
characters: when you start a new line in e-mail or news your TCP/IP =
software=20
translates whatever your mailer/newsreader uses to start a new line into =
the=20

(carriage-return followed by line-feed). The effect of inserting an =
isolated=20
carriage-return or line-feed (whichever of them happens not to be used =
to=20
indicate new lines on your computer) is unpredictable.=20
<H2><A name=3Demail>E-mail</A></H2>Despite various extensions, you =
should still=20
regard e-mail as being 7-bit, US-ASCII unless you are <EM>certain</EM> =
that the=20
recipient can handle <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#mime">MIME</A>=
 and has=20
access to the same character set that you are using.=20
<P>Although the e-mail transfer protocol has been extended to allow the =
transfer=20
of 8-bit characters, a significant fraction of mail transfer agents =
(mail=20
sending software, mail receiving software and mail gateways) are still=20
restricted to 7&nbsp;bits. So even if your software is capable of =
sending 8-bit=20
characters, they may not arrive at the destination intact: 8-bit =
characters may=20
be discarded entirely or may mutate into 7-bit characters by having the=20
top&nbsp;bit set to zero. This means that if you write:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>German Schlo=DF for sale in K=F6ln, only =A3250,000. =
</BLOCKQUOTE>it may=20
turn into (if 8-bit characters are discarded):=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>German Schlo for sale in Kln, only 250,000. </BLOCKQUOTE>or =
(if=20
8-bit characters have their top bit set to zero):=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>German Schlo_ for sale in Kvln, only #250,000. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Even if you are lucky enough that your message gets through intact, =
your=20
recipient may not be using the same 8-bit character set as yourself. =
Although=20
ISO&nbsp;8859/1 is very common (being designed to serve the needs of =
several=20
European languages), there are many other ISO&nbsp;8859 character sets =
and even=20
more 8-bit character sets that are not part of ISO&nbsp;8859. The =
standard Mac=20
Roman encoding for character sets has many (but not all) of the =
ISO&nbsp;8859/1=20
characters but few of the characters are in the same position as in=20
ISO&nbsp;8859/1. People in different countries will use the character =
set=20
appropriate to their country, which may or may not match yours. As far =
as=20
English speaking countries go, any character set which is compatible =
with=20
US&nbsp;ASCII will serve, and incompatibilities may only surface when =
you need=20
to send a currency symbol or a non-English character.=20
<P>Actually, even 7-bit US ASCII is not guaranteed to reach all =
recipients=20
unchanged. Some older software running on some mail gateways (notably =
those that=20
use the EBCDIC character set) has problems with the following =
characters:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>[\]^`{|}~
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Generally, the Internet community regards software that incorrectly =
handles=20
these characters as "broken" but that is of no help if you're mailing C =
source=20
code to somebody. Fortunately, this software is extremely rare these =
days.=20
<H2><A name=3Dmime>MIME</A></H2>A way of getting around the problems of =
7-bit=20
e-mail transfer is to use <DFN>MIME</DFN> (Multipurpose Internet Mail=20
Extensions). MIME has many modes of operation, but normally if you =
include an=20
8-bit character in an item of e-mail a MIME-aware mailer will convert =
the=20
message into "quoted-printable" form and use special sequences of =
characters=20
starting with an equals sign (<SAMP>=3D</SAMP>) to encode the 8-bit =
characters.=20
<P>The first problem with using MIME in e-mail is that not everyone has =
a=20
MIME-capable mailer. You must <EM>always</EM> ensure that your recipient =
can=20
handle MIME before sending MIME-encoded e-mail. What happens if the =
recipient=20
does not have a MIME-capable mailer is that if you send:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>German Schlo=DF for sale in K=F6ln, only =A3250000 =
(=3D$375000).=20
</BLOCKQUOTE>he will see:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE>German Schlo=3DDF for sale in K=3DF6ln, only =3DA3250000 =
(=3D3D$375000).=20
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Raw MIME is extremely confusing. Your recipient might figure out that =

"<SAMP>Schlo=3DDF</SAMP>" means "Schlo=DF" and that =
"<SAMP>K=3DF6ln</SAMP>" means=20
"K=F6ln." It is very likely that he may think that "<SAMP>=3DA</SAMP>" =
is an obscure=20
way of representing "=A3" and that you're asking =A33250000 for your =
"Schlo=3DDF"=20
(this sort of mistake is <EM>very</EM> common in these circumstances). =
The fact=20
that your message already contained an equals sign is unfortunate =
because it=20
gets turned into <SAMP>=3D3D</SAMP> and just adds to the confusion. And =
just to=20
make things worse, if your message had trailing blanks at the end of a =
line then=20
MIME adds equals signs to the ends of those lines.=20
<P>The second problem with using MIME in e-mail is that not everyone is =
using=20
the same character set as yourself. MIME will automatically include =
details of=20
your character set so your recipient's software can automatically select =
the=20
appropriate character set&nbsp;- <EM>if</EM> that character set happens =
to be=20
available or the software knows how to synthesize it from available =
character=20
sets. Even so, you must ensure that your recipient can deal with your =
character=20
set before using MIME.=20
<H2><A name=3Dnews>News</A></H2>News articles are essentially a superset =
of e-mail=20
messages, although the transmission method differs. This means that they =
have=20
the same restrictions as e-mail messages, namely that the protocol =
specifies the=20
use of the printable characters of US&nbsp;ASCII (ISO&nbsp;646-US).=20
<P>Modern news server software is "8-bit clean" which means that it =
passes 8-bit=20
characters correctly. However, a lot of news servers are still running =
older=20
software which is not 8-bit clean (which means it drops or mutates 8-bit =

characters just as with e-mail). Not only that, but news is global in =
scope so=20
many people will <EM>not</EM> be using the same 8-bit character set as =
yourself=20
and even if 8-bit characters reach them intact they will see something =
entirely=20
different to what you wrote.=20
<P>MIME is <EM>not</EM> a feasible solution to the problem of sending =
8-bit=20
characters. MIME should only be used when you can guarantee that your =
recipient=20
can handle it. Since you have no knowledge or control over who receives =
your=20
news article, you cannot guarantee that they can cope with MIME.=20
<P>Note that some countries operate a closed group of news servers =
guaranteed to=20
be 8-bit clean and with the convention that articles posted to those =
servers use=20
a single, agreed character set. If, and <EM>only</EM> if, your article =
is being=20
posted to a closed community of news servers then you may use 8-bit =
characters=20
(provided you post using the correct character set). Newsgroups in the =
major=20
hierarchies (<SAMP>alt</SAMP>, <SAMP>biz</SAMP>, <SAMP>comp</SAMP>,=20
<SAMP>humanities</SAMP>, <SAMP>misc</SAMP>, <SAMP>news</SAMP>, =
<SAMP>rec</SAMP>,=20
<SAMP>sci</SAMP>, <SAMP>soc</SAMP>, <SAMP>talk</SAMP>, etc.) as well as =
most=20
English-speaking hierarchies (such as <SAMP>uk</SAMP>) are <EM>not</EM> =
in a=20
closed community of this kind and you <EM>should</EM> restrict your =
posts in=20
those hierarchies to US&nbsp;ASCII.=20
<H2><A name=3Dwww>World Wide Web</A></H2>The base character set for web =
pages,=20
used by default, is <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#iso8859/1">ISO=
&nbsp;8859/1</A>.=20
Other character sets and encoding schemes may be used (such as the =
Japanese=20
JUNET encoding of ISO&nbsp;2022-JP or Unicode UCS-2 format) but these =
are=20
outside the scope of this document. This section assumes that the =
default=20
ISO&nbsp;8859/1 character set is being used.=20
<P>HTML allows you to enter all valid ISO&nbsp;8859/1 characters =
directly.=20
However, the 8-bit characters which are not in the ASCII =
(ISO&nbsp;646-US)=20
character set cause problems for those who are limited to retrieving web =
pages=20
by e-mail because e-mail cannot be guaranteed to transmit other than =
ASCII=20
characters correctly. It also causes problems for people using Apple =
Macs=20
because most Mac browsers have problems with 8-bit characters entered =
directly.=20
It is therefore considered good practise to use <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#entity_numeric=
">character=20
entities</A> (such as <SAMP>&amp;aelig;</SAMP> for "=E6") or <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#entity_numeric=
">numeric=20
character references</A> (such as <SAMP>&amp;#163;</SAMP> for =A3) =
unless your=20
document contains so many 8-bit characters as to make this impractical.=20
<P>The characters:=20
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>[\]^`{|}~
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>may also cause problems when web pages are retrieved =
by=20
e-mail if the e-mail passes through (now rare) older mail gateways, but =
it is=20
not considered necessary to use numeric character references to deal =
with those=20
in ordinary text (it is considered necessary to URL-encode them when =
they appear=20
in <A=20
href=3D"http://www.jhall.demon.co.uk/currency/charset.html#url-encoding">=
URLs</A>).=20

<P>One extension to HTML, which is an adjunct to most versions of HTML =
but=20
incorporated into HTML version&nbsp;4, is the ability to refer to =
characters in=20
the Unicode character set. The first&nbsp;255 characters of the Unicode=20
character set are identical to the ISO&nbsp;8859/1 character set (in the =
same=20
way that the first&nbsp;128 characters of the ISO&nbsp;8859/1 character =
set are=20
identical to the ASCII character set). Unicode characters can be entered =
means=20
of numeric character references greater than&nbsp;255 (such as=20
<SAMP>&amp;#8352;</SAMP> to give the Euro currency symbol). This depends =
on=20
browsers having Unicode support <EM>and</EM> the user having Unicode =
fonts which=20
contain the relevant symbols. Older browsers may display nothing at all, =
an=20
error marker, or a totally incorrect character (usually a character from =

ISO&nbsp;8859/1). Some older browsers may even crash when confronted =
with a=20
numeric character reference greater than&nbsp;255. Until Unicode support =
is much=20
more widespread you should think very carefully before using Unicode =
characters=20
in web pages.=20
<H2><A name=3Dentity_numeric>HTML Character Entities and Numeric =
Character=20
References for ISO&nbsp;8859/1 Characters</A></H2>HTML has two =
mechanisms (which=20
do <EM>not</EM> work for e-mail or news) for referring to characters =
that are=20
difficult to enter from the keyboard, are subject to corruption when =

<OL>
  <LI>Numeric character references should work with any browser.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Character entities are generally preferable to numeric character=20

source.=20
  However, early drafts of the HTML specification defined character =
entities=20
  only for letters not in the English alphabet and accented characters. =
Older=20
  browsers do not understand other (non-alphabetic) character entities, =
which is=20
  why the table below gives a preferred form. The non-breaking space is =
an=20
  exception to this since there are roughly the same number of browsers =
that=20
  have problems with <SAMP>&amp;#160;</SAMP> as <SAMP>&amp;nbsp;</SAMP>. =

  <P></P>
  <LI>The semicolon terminating character entities and numeric character =

  references may be omitted if the following character would not be =
interpreted=20
  as part of the entity or numeric reference. However, since most people =
don't=20
  know what characters are and aren't valid in entity names, it's safest =
to=20
  always include the terminating semicolon. Even if you happen to =
understand the=20
