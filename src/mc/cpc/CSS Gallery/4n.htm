      At the recent Typo Berlin &#39;96 conference, Neville Brody described the current 
      state of Web design as being largely devoid of content. Coining dubious terms 
      such as &#39;post-design&#39; and &#39;post-information&#39;, he portrayed the Internet as 
      a space where the HTML-literate are displaying experimental graphics: client-free, 
      brief-free, without quality-control, purpose or an audience beyond fellow 
      designers. <br>
      <br>
      This is a misleading generalisation. There is a vast amount of useful, socially-oriented 
      content, though most of it appears untouched by graphic designers - and is 
      often clearer because of it. Commercial sites debut at a rapid rate as companies, 
      fearful of missing the Internet bandwagon, translate printed matter to the 
      screen. In the rush, texts are often unplanned and undesigned - or at least 
      not re-planned or re-designed for the new medium. At the moment, there appears 
      to be an enormous amount of undesigned information, and a great number of 
      designers with not enough work and too much time. The two have yet to resolve 
      each other, though the formation of studios dealing exclusively with design 
      for the Web looks set to rectify this.

    <div CLASS="copy">
      The current phase of Web sites reproducing the organisation and style of printed 
      matter was outlined at Berlin by Matthew Butterick. His now-familiar idea 
      of media in transition suggests the period of copying a precedent is a natural 
      stage found in all past media revolutions. This description has tended to 
      refer to Web pages that reproduce the essential linearity of book design, 
      whilst cautiously realising the potential of non-linear hypertext. It also 
      suggests a more general trend: that the &#39;designer Web pages&#39; identified by 
      Brody are merely reflecting an increasingly inward-looking, self-referential 
      graphic design scene, and can only compound the problem. <br>
      <br>
      London&#39;s design bookshops are full of large hardback volumes of new-wave / 
      deconstructed / post-modern graphics from an international roster of designers. 
      They appear in the form of &#39;awards&#39;, &#39;yearbooks&#39; or &#39;best-of&#39; collections, 
      with an effect significant and widespread enough to be viewed as a distinct 
      genre. Such books appear to have supplanted the traditional designer&#39;s handbook. 
      Of course, collections of work have been around since graphic design became 
      a recognised profession, but particularly since the first <i>Typography Now</i> 
      title was published in Britain a few years ago, the publication and importation 
      of these books has soared.

    <div CLASS="head4">

    <div CLASS="copy">
      Given the abundance and expense of these books, they must be selling, so who 
      is buying them? Surely too expensive for students, it appears that more and 
      more design studios are filling their shelves with these volumes. Judging 
      by the prevailing vogue for an increasingly-diluted graphic form, still heavily 
      derived from Mac-based distortion, they are used as instant reference resources 
      for a quick piece of zeitgeist-design: fast-food graphics. <br>
      <br>
      The new-wave forms are inevitably processed; sanitised from supposedly radical 
      roots, until they become as uninspiring and formulated as the tired work in 
      Phaidon&#39;s recent &#39;A Smile in the Mind&#39; (from what could be considered the 
      opposite end of the graphic scale). Both are unjustly revered. The generic 
      new-wave copybook consists of miniature reproductions of posters, or poster-like 
      books and magazines, plus the eternally designer-friendly record sleeves. 
      Generally they appear without enlightening descriptions of context, client, 
      cost or audience - the basic information necessary to bring any given design 
      into the real world, to provide a basis for analysis, judgement, and, most 
      importantly, criticism. Without it, the work is just wallpaper. Worse yet, 
      in the latest <i>Typography Now 2</i> there are reproductions of student project 
      work - items that never had serious workable constraints in the first place. 
      You can&#39;t help feeling that work may be undertaken primarily to get into one 
      of these books; a kind of instant empty fame, from art-school colour-rip to 
      coffee-table gloss. The ever-increasing numbers of these books reveals only 
      how many people want them. Feeding off itself, surely this genre is not in 
      a healthy state. Perhaps there&#39;s nowhere else for it to go. <br>
      <br>
      There is a widely accepted argument that plagiarising previous design is a 
      useful part of the learning process. Obvious enough, perhaps, but this is 
      copyism at its basest level - reproducing surface form and little else. If 
      design is problem-solving - thinking - then the proliferation of these books 
      can only be anti-design, justified by the spurious claims of personal expression, 
      blurring of art/design boundaries, competing with an increasingly multimedia-oriented 
      society etc. The arguments are familiar by now, but none are convincing.
      <br>
      <br>
      Where are the critical books with analytical text that would allow some real 
      insight? These books and their Internet counterparts only mirror &#39;90s society 
      clichés: fragmentation, tribalism, codes, information-saturation, infotainment, 
      cheap/quick thrills, the short attention span, obsession with pastiche, retro-decades 
      from the &#39;50s onwards, or equally self-conscious techno imagery as our current 
      representative. The trouble is, too many designers are happy enough reflecting 
      the time, when they have the privilege and influence to change it; to enhance 
      it; to make it better.
