<h3 align="center">I have lying, over me in Halicarnassus, a gigantic monument such 
as no other dead person has, adorned in the finest way with statues of horses and 
men carved most realistically from the best quality marble.</h3>

<hr>
<p>Similar to the <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/pyramid.html">Great 
Pyramid</a>, we are now visiting the burial place of an ancient king. Yet the Mausoleum 
is different - so different from the Pyramid that it earned its reputation - and 
a spot within the list - for other reasons. Geographically, it is closer to the
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/artemis.html">Temple of Artemis</a>... 
And it was the beauty of the tomb rather than its size that fascinated its visitors 
for years. </p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>In the city of <a href="http://turkey.org/turkey/bodrum.htm">Bodrum</a> (f.k.a. 
Halicarnassus) on the Aegean Sea, in south-west
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/turkey/">Turkey</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the <a href="http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~sebrahi/PersiaNet.html">Persians</a> 
expanded their ancient kingdom to include Mesopotamia, Northern India, Syria, Egypt, 
and Asia Minor, the king could not control his vast empire without the help of local 
governors or rulers -- the Satraps. Like many other provinces, the kingdom of Caria 
in the western part of Asia Minor (Turkey) was so far from the Persian capital that 
it was practically autonomous. From 377 to 353 BC, king Mausollos of Caria reigned 
and moved his capital to Halicarnassus. Nothing is exciting about Maussollos life 
except the construction of his tomb. The project was conceived by his wife and sister 
Artemisia, and the construction might have started during the king&#39;s lifetime. The 
Mausoleum was completed around 350 BC, three years after Maussollos death, and one 
year after Artemisia&#39;s. </p>
<p>For 16 centuries, the Mausoleum remained in good condition until an earthquake 
caused some damage to the roof and colonnade. In the early fifteenth century, the
<a href="http://www.kwtelecom.com/heraldry/stjohn/sovord.html">Knights of St John</a> 
of <a href="http://www.fred.net/malta/home.html">Malta</a> invaded the region and 
built a massive crusader castle. When they decided to fortify it in 1494, they used 
the stones of the Mausoleum. By 1522, almost every block of the Mausoleum had been 
disassembled and used for construction. </p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/users/candan/turkey/bodrum1.gif">massive 
castle</a> still stands in Bodrum, and the polished stone and marble blocks of the 
Mausoleum can be spotted within the walls of the structure. Some of the sculptures 
survived and are today on display at the
<a href="http://www.british-museum.ac.uk/">British Museum in London</a>. These include 
fragment of statues and many slabs of the frieze showing the battle between the 
Greeks and the Amazons. At the site of the Mausoleum itself, only the foundation 
remains of the once magnificent Wonder. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The structure was rectangular in plan, with base dimensions of about 40 m (120 
ft) by 30 m (100 ft). Overlying the foundation was a stepped podium which sides 
were decorated with statues. The burial chamber and the sarcophagus of white alabaster 
decorated with gold were located on the podium and surrounded by Ionic columns. 
The colonnade supported a pyramid roof which was in turn decorated with statues. 
A statue of a chariot pulled by four horses adorned the top of the tomb. </p>
<p>The total height of the Mausoleum was 45 m (140 ft). This is broken down into 
20 m (60 ft) for the stepped podium, 12 m (38 ft) for the colonnade, 7 m (22 ft) 
for the pyramid, and 6 m (20 ft) for the chariot statue at the top. </p>
<p>The beauty of the Mausoleum is not only in the structure itself, but in the decorations 
and statues that adorned the outside at different levels on the podium and the roof. 
These were tens of life-size as well as under and over life-size free-standing statues 
of people, lions, horses, and other animals. The statues were carved by four Greek 
sculptors: Bryaxis, Leochares, Scopas, and Timotheus, each responsible for one side. 
Because the statues were of people and animals, the Mausoleum holds a special place 
in history as it was not dedicated to the gods of Ancient Greece. </p>
<p>Since the nineteenth century, archeological excavations have been undertaken 
at the Mausoleum site. These excavations together with detailed descriptions by 
ancient historians give us a fairly good idea about the shape and appearance of 
the Mausoleum. <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/maus.jpg">A 
modern reconstruction</a> of the shorter side of the Mausoleum illustrates the lavish 
nature of the art and architecture of the building... a building for a King whose 
name is celebrated in all large tombs today -- mausoleums. </p>
