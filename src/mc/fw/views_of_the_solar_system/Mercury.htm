<!-- INBODYEND --><a NAME="intro">Mercury</a> was named by the Romans after the 
fleet-footed messenger of the gods because it seemed to move more quickly than any 
other planet. It is the closest planet to the <a HREF="sun.htm">Sun</a>, and second 
smallest planet in the <a HREF="solarsys.htm">solar system</a>. Its diameter is 
40% smaller than <a HREF="earth.htm">Earth</a> and 40% larger than the
<a HREF="moon.htm">Moon</a>. It is even smaller than <a HREF="jupiter.htm">Jupiter&#39;s</a> 
moon <a HREF="ganymede.htm">Ganymede</a> and <a HREF="saturn.htm">Saturn&#39;s</a> moon
<a HREF="titan.htm">Titan</a>.
<p>If an explorer were to step onto the surface of Mercury, he would discover a 
world resembling lunar terrain. Mercury&#39;s rolling, dust-covered hills have been 
eroded from the constant bombardment of <a HREF="Meteorites.htm">meteorites</a>. Fault-cliffs 
rise for several kilometers in height and extend for hundreds of kilometers. Craters 
dot the surface. The explorer would notice that the Sun appears two and a half times 
larger than on Earth; however, the sky is always black because Mercury has virtually 
no atmosphere to cause scattering of light. As the explorer gazes out into space, 
he might see two bright stars. One appearing as cream colored
<a HREF="venus.htm">Venus</a> and the other as blue colored <a HREF="earth.htm">
Earth</a>. </p>
<p>Until <a HREF="marin10.htm">Mariner 10</a>, little was known about Mercury because 
of the difficulty in observing it from Earth telescopes. At maximum elongation it 
is only 28 degrees from the Sun as seen from Earth. Because of this, it can only 
be viewed during daylight hours or just prior to sunrise or after sunset. When observed 
at dawn or dusk, Mercury is so low on the horizon that the light must pass through 
10 times the amount of Earth&#39;s atmosphere than it would if Mercury was directly 
overhead. </p>
<p>During the 1880&#39;s, Giovanni Schiaparelli drew a sketch showing faint features 
on Mercury. He determined that Mercury must be tidally locked to the Sun, just as 
the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. In 1962, radio astronomers looked at radio 
emissions from Mercury and determined that the dark side was too warm to be tidally 
locked. It was expected to be much colder if it always faced away from the Sun. 
In 1965, Pettengill and Dyce determined Mercury&#39;s period of rotation to be 59 +- 
5 days based upon radar observations. Later in 1971, Goldstein refined the rotation 
period to be 58.65 +- 0.25 days using radar observations. After close observation 
by the Mariner 10 spacecraft, the period was determined to be 58.646 +- 0.005 days.
</p>
<p>Although Mercury is not tidally locked to the Sun, its rotational period is tidally 
coupled to its orbital period. Mercury rotates one and a half times during each 
orbit. Because of this 3:2 resonance, a day on Mercury (sun rise to sun rise) is 
176 Earth days long as shown by the following diagram. </p>

<p>During Mercury&#39;s distant past, its period of rotation may have been faster. Scientists 
speculate that its rotation could have been as rapid as 8 hours, but over millions 
of years it was slowly despun by solar tides. A model of this process shows that 
such a despinning would take 10<sup>9</sup> years and would have raised the interior 
temperature by 100 degrees Kelvin. </p>
<p>Most of the scientific findings about Mercury comes from the
<a HREF="marin10.htm">Mariner 10</a> spacecraft which was launched on November 3, 
1973. It flew past the planet on March 29, 1974 at a distance of 705 kilometers 
from the surface. On September 21, 1974 it flew past Mercury for the second time 
and on March 16, 1975 for the third time. During these visits, over 2,700 pictures 
were taken, covering 45% of Mercury&#39;s surface. Up until this time, scientists did 
not suspect that Mercury would have a <a HREF="terms.htm#magneticfield">magnetic 
field</a>. They thought that because Mercury is small, its core would have solidified 
long ago. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that a planet has an iron core 
that is at least partially molten. Magnetic fields are generated from the rotation 
of a conductive molten core and is known as the dynamo effect. </p>
<p>Mariner 10 showed that Mercury has a magnetic field that is 1% as strong as Earth&#39;s. 
This magnet field is inclined 7 degrees to Mercury&#39;s axis of rotation and produces 
a <a HREF="terms.htm#magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a> around the planet. The source 
of the magnetic field is unknown. It might be produced from a partially molten iron 
core in the planet&#39;s interior. Another source of the field might be from remnant 
magnetization of iron-bearing rocks which were magnetized when the planet had a 
strong magnetic field during its younger years. As the planet cooled and solidified 
remnant magnetization was retained. </p>
<p>Even before Mariner 10, Mercury was known to have a high
<a HREF="terms.htm#density">density</a>. Its density is 5.44 g/cm<sup>3</sup> which 
is comparable to Earth&#39;s 5.52g/cm<sup>3</sup> density. In an uncompressed state, 
Mercury&#39;s density is 5.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> where Earth&#39;s is only 4.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. 
This high density indicates that the planet is 60 to 70 percent by weight metal, 
and 30 percent by weight silicate. This gives a core radius of 75% of the planet 
radius and a core volume of 42% of the planet&#39;s volume. </p>
<h3>Surface of Mercury</h3>
The pictures returned from the Mariner 10 spacecraft showed a world that resembles 
the moon. It is pocked with craters, contains hugh multi-ring basins, and many lava 
flows. The craters range in size from 100 meters (the smallest resolvable feature 
on Mariner 10 images) to 1,300 kilometers. They are in various stages of preservation. 
Some are young with sharp rims and bright rays extending from them. Others are highly 
degraded, with rims that have been smoothed from the bombardment of meteorites. 
The largest crater on Mercury is the <a HREF="#caloris">Caloris basin</a>. A basin 
was defined by Hartmann and Kuiper (1962) as a &quot;large circular depression with distinctive 
concentric rings and radial lineaments.&quot; Others consider any crater larger than 
200 kilometers a basin. The Caloris basin is 1,300 kilometers in diameter, and was 
probably caused by a projectile larger than 100 kilometers in size. The impact produced 
concentric mountain rings three kilometers high and sent ejecta 600 to 800 kilometers 
across the planet. (Another good example of a basin showing concentric rings is 
the <a HREF="callisto.htm#valhalla">Valhalla region</a> on <a HREF="jupiter.htm">
Jupiter&#39;s</a> moon <a HREF="callisto.htm">Callisto</a>.) The seismic waves produced 
from the Caloris impact focused onto the other side of the planet and produced a 
region of chaotic terrain. After the impact the crater was partially filled with 
lava flows.
<p>Mercury is marked with great curved cliffs or lobate scarps that were apparently 
formed as Mercury cooled and shrank a few kilometers in size. This shrinking produced 
a wrinkled crust with scarps kilometers high and hundreds of kilometers long.
</p>
<p>The majority of Mercury&#39;s surface is covered by plains. Much of it is old and 
heavily cratered, but some of the plains are less heavily cratered. Scientists have 
classified these plains as intercrater plains and smooth plains. Intercrater plains 
are less saturated with craters and the craters are less than 15 kilometers in diameter. 
These plains were probably formed as lava flows buried the older terrain. The smooth 
plains are younger still with fewer craters. Smooth plains can be found around the 
Caloris basin. In some areas patches of smooth lava can be seen filling craters.
</p>
<p>Mercury&#39;s history of formation is similar to that of Earth&#39;s. About 4.5 billion 
years ago the planets formed. This was a time of intense bombardment for the planets 
as they scooped up matter and debris left around from the nebula that formed them. 
Early during this formation, Mercury probably differentiated into a dense metallic 
core, and a silicate crust. After the intense bombardment period, lava flowed across 
the surface and covered the older crust. By this time much of the debris had been 
swept up and Mercury entered a lighter bombardment period. During this period the 
intercrater plains formed. Then Mercury cooled. Its core contracted which in turn 
broke the crust and produced the prominent lobate scarps. During the third stage, 
lava flooded the lowlands and produced the smooth plains. During the fourth stage 
micrometeorite bombardment created a dusty surface also known as regolith. A few 
larger meteorites impacted the surface and left bright rayed craters. Other than 
the occasional collisions of a meteorites, Mercury&#39;s surface is no longer active 
and remains the same as it has for millions of years. </p>
<h3>Could water exist on Mercury?</h3>
It would appear that Mercury could not support water in any form. It has very little 
atmosphere and is blazing hot during the day, but in 1991 scientists at Caltech 
bounced radio waves off Mercury and found an unusual bright return from the north 
pole. The apparent brightening at the north pole could be explained by ice on or 
just under the surface. But is it possible for Mercury to have ice? Because Mercury&#39;s 
rotation is almost perpendicular to its orbital plain, the north pole always sees 
the sun just above the horizon. The insides of craters would never be exposed to 
the Sun and scientists suspect that they would remain colder than -161 C. These 
freezing temperatures could trap water outgassed from the planet, or ices brought 
to the planet from cometary impacts. These ice deposits might be covered with a 
layer of dust and would still show bright radar returns.

Most of what is known about the internal structure of Mercury comes from data acquired 
by the Mariner 10 spacecraft that flew past the planet in 1973 and 1974. Mercury 
is about a third of the size of Earth, yet its density is comparable to that of 
Earth. This indicates that Mercury has a large core roughly the size of Earth&#39;s 
moon or about 75% of the planet&#39;s radius. The core is likely composed of 60 to 70% 
iron by mass. Mariner 10&#39;s measurements of the planet reveals a dipolar magnetic 
field possibly produced by a partially molten core. A solid rocky mantle surrounds 
the core with a thin crust of about 100 kilometers. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton)</i>

an impact of a projectile with asteroid dimensions. The interior floor of the basin 
contains smooth plains but is highly ridged and fractured. North is towards the 
top of this image. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton; FDS 188-199)</i>

This image shows two prominent craters (upper right) with bright halos on Mercury. 
The craters are about 40 kilometers (25 miles) in diameter. The halos and rays cover 
other features on the surface indicating that they are some of the youngest on Mercury.

This image shows a double-ring basin which is 200 kilometers (120 miles) in diameter. 
The floor contains smooth plains material. The inner ring basin is at a lower elevation 
than the outer ring. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton; FDS 27301)</i>

This Mariner 10 image shows Santa Maria <a HREF="terms.htm#rupes">Rupes</a>, the 
sinuous dark feature running through the crater at the center of this image. Many 
such features were discovered in the Mariner images of Mercury and are interpreted 
to be enormous thrust <a HREF="terms.htm#fault">faults</a> where part of the mercurian 
crust was pushed slightly over an adjacent part by compressional forces. The abundance 
and length of the thrust faults indicate that the radius of Mercury decreased by 
1-2 kilometers (.6 - 1.2 miles) after the solidification and impact cratering of 
the surface. This volume change probably was due to the cooling of the planet, following 
the formation of a metallic core three-fourths the size of the planet. North is 
towards the top and is 200 kilometers (120 miles) across. <i>(© Copyright 1998 by

This is an image of a 450 kilometer (280 mile) ridge called Antoniadi. It travels 
along the right edge of the image, and transects a large 80 kilometer (50 mile) 
crater about half way in between. It crosses smooth plains to the north and intercrater 
plains to the south [Strom et al., 1975]. <i>(Copyright Calvin J. Hamilton)</i>
