<hr>
<p>Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, only one had a practical use in addition 
to its architectural elegance: The Lighthouse of Alexandria. For sailors, it ensured 
a safe return to the Great Harbor. For architects, it meant even more: it was the 
tallest building on Earth. And for scientists, it was the mysterious mirror that 
fascinated them most... The mirror which reflection could be seen more than 50 km 
(35 miles) off-shore. </p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>On the ancient island of Pharos, now a promontory within the city of
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/index.html">Alexandria</a> in
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/index.html">Egypt</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after the death of
<a href="http://www.wallop.demon.co.uk/alexander/index.htm">Alexander the Great</a>, 
his commander
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/History/ptolemaic.html">Ptolemy 
Soter</a> assumed power in Egypt. He had witnessed the
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/History/founding.html">founding</a> 
of Alexandria, and established his capital there. Off of the city&#39;s coast lies a 
small island: Pharos. Its name, legend says, is a variation of <i>Pharaoh&#39;s Island</i>, 
but it is more likely that the name is Greek in origin. The island was connected 
to the mainland by means of a dike - the Heptastadion - which gave the city a
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/Gallery/old_map.gif">double harbor</a>. 
And because of dangerous sailing conditions and flat coastline in the region, the 
construction of a lighthouse was necessary. </p>
<p>The project was conceived and initiated by Ptolemy Soter around 290 BC, but was 
completed after his death, during the reign of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus. Sostratus, 
a contemporary of
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Euclid.html">
Euclid</a>, was the architect, but detailed calculations for the structure and its 
accessories were carried out at the
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/History/legacy.html">Alexandria 
Library/Mouseion</a>. The monument was dedicated to the <i>Savior Gods</i>: Ptolemy 
Soter (<i>lit.</i> savior) and his wife Berenice. For centuries, the Lighthouse 
of Alexandria (occasionally referred to as the Pharos Lighthouse) was used to mark 
the harbor, using fire at night and reflecting sun rays during the day. It was even 
shown on Roman coins, just as famous monuments are depicted on currency today.
</p>
<p>When the Arabs conquered Egypt, they admired Alexandria and its wealth. The Lighthouse 
continues to be mentioned in their writings and travelers accounts. But the new 
rulers moved their capital to Cairo since they had no ties to the Mediterranean. 
When the mirror was brought down mistakenly, they did not restore it back into place. 
In AD 956, an earthquake shook Alexandria, and caused little damage to the Lighthouse. 
It was later in 1303 and in 1323 that two stronger earthquakes left a significant 
impression on the structure. When the famous Arab traveler
<a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~basoglu/history/batuta.html">Ibn Battuta</a> visited 
Alexandria in 1349, he could not enter the ruinous monument or even climb to its 
doorway. </p>
<p>The final chapter in the history of the Lighthouse came in AD 1480 when the Egyptian 
Mamelouk Sultan, Qaitbay, decided to fortify Alexandria&#39;s defense. He built a
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/Gallery/qaitbay2.jpg">medieval 
fort</a> on the same spot where the Lighthouse once stood, using the fallen stone 
and marble. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Of the six vanished Wonders, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was the last to disappear. 
Therefore we have adequately accurate knowledge of its location and appearance. 
Ancient accounts such as those by Strabo and
<a href="http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/bartlett/485.html">Pliny the Elder</a> 
give us a brief description of the &quot;tower&quot; and the magnificent white marble cover. 
They tell us how the mysterious mirror could reflect the light tens of kilometers 
away. Legend says the mirror was also used to detect and burn enemy ships before 
they could reach the shore. </p>
<p>In 1166, an Arab traveler, Abou-Haggag Al-Andaloussi visited the Lighthouse. 
He documented a wealth of information and gave an accurate description of the structure 
which helped modern archeologists
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/pharos_bw1.jpg">reconstruct</a> 
the monument. It was composed of three stages: The lowest square, 55.9 m (183.4 
ft) high with a cylindrical core; the middle octagonal with a side length of 18.30 
m (60.0 ft) and a height of 27.45 m (90.1 ft); and the third circular 7.30 m (24.0 
ft) high. The total height of the building including the foundation base was about 
117 m (384 ft), equivalent to a 40-story modern building. The internal core was 
used as a shaft to lift the fuel needed for the fire. At the top stage, the mirror 
reflected sunlight during the day while fire was used during the night. In ancient 
times, a statue of
<a href="http://www.greece.org/poseidon/work/argonautika/cosmo6.html">Poseidon</a> 
adorned the summit of the building. </p>
<p>Although the Lighthouse of Alexandria did not survive to the present day, it 
left its influence in various respects. From an architectural standpoint, the monument 
has been used as a model for many prototypes along the Mediterranean, as far away 
as Spain. And from a linguistic standpoint, it gave its name -- Pharos -- to all 
the <a href="http://www.maine.com/lights/www_vl.htm">lighthouses</a> in the world... 
Just look up the dictionary for the French, Italian, or Spanish word for <i>lighthouse</i>.
