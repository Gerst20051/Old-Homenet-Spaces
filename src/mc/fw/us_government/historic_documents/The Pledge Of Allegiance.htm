  <h2>Guidelines for Displaying the Flag</h2>
  <pre>     1.  The flag of the United States should be flown daily from sunrise to 
         sunset in good weather from public buildings, schools, permanent 
         staffs, and in or near polling places on election days.  The flag 
         may be displayed 24 hours a day on patriotic holidays or if properly
         illuminated.

     2.  The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is bad, 
         except when an all-weather flag is used.

     3.  The flag should always be flown on national and state holidays and 
         on those occasions proclaimed by the President.  On Memorial Day, 
         the flag should be half staffed until noon.

     4.  The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.  It
         should never be dipped to any person nor should it ever be displayed 
         with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress.

     5.  The flag should never touch anything beneath it, nor should it ever
         be carried flat or horizontally.

     6.  It should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, drapery, or 
         decoration, nor for carrying or holding anything.

     7.  The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored
         in such a manner as to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged.  It should
         never be used as a covering for a ceiling.

     8.  The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of
         a vehicle.  When a flag is displayed on a car, the flag&#39;s staff
         should be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the right
         fender.

     9.  The flag or its staff should never be used for advertising purposes
         in any manner whatsoever.  Nor should any picture, drawing, insignia
         or other decoration be placed on or attached to the flag, its staff,
         or halyard.

     10. The flag should not be embroidered on cushions, handkerchiefs, or
         other personal items nor printed on anything designed for temporary
         use and discarded.  However, a flag patch may be affixed to the 
         uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, or members of
         other patriotic organizations.

     11. When the flag is so worn or soiled that it is no longer suitable
         for display, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner,
         preferably by burning.
