<p align="center">Your pre-teen&#39;s life is all about changes — emotional, physical, 
and academic. Help her cope so her schoolwork doesn&#39;t suffer. </p>
<p>As your child starts middle school, you&#39;ll notice some big differences in your 
soon-to-be-teen. Not only has her appearance changed, but so has her attitude. Rather 
than sharing all the wonderful things she has learned in class like she used to, 
she answers your daily &quot;How was school today?&quot; query with a predictable &quot;Fine&quot; as 
she trudges past you to her room. And just what <i>does</i> she do in those hours 
spent alone in her inner sanctum?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Change itself is just about the only thing you can count on at this point in your 
child&#39;s development. Physical, emotional, and academic changes abound. All can be 
jarring and distracting as your middle schooler strives to settle into a routine. 
Here&#39;s a guide to common distractions and what you can do to ease them.<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<b><a name="Body"></a>What&#39;s Happening to My Body?</b><br>
Every preteen is going to go through physical changes, but remember that kids develop 
at different paces. So when you look at a list of common physical changes your preteen 
will face, it&#39;s not only daunting, but there&#39;s no indication of when these changes 
will occur:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rocketing height </li>
  <li>Starting menstruation </li>
  <li>Cracking voices </li>
  <li>Getting braces </li>
  <li>Spurting limbs </li>
  <li>Raging hormones </li>
  <li>Wearing bras </li>
  <li>Battling baby fat </li>
  <li>Sweating palms </li>
  <li>Developing acne</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
No wonder concentrating in class is an uphill battle. Imagine wondering whether 
your new deodorant is working when you raise your hand, or stressing about whether 
your voice will crack if you answer a question. What can you do to ease the constant 
worry? &quot;Tell the truth early on about physical and emotional changes, using the 
correct vocabulary about body parts, and talk, talk, talk to your preteen!&quot; advises 
a parent of three teenagers. &quot;Keep communication open. Make him feel that he can 
come to you for anything.&quot; Also, be understanding of the widespread awkwardness 
and know that this is simply what kids go through.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One mom from upstate New York offers her experience with talking to her preteen 
son about puberty: &quot;My son was very comfortable asking questions and interested 
in the physical and emotional changes he will be going through,&quot; she says. &quot;We also 
discussed what changes girls will be experiencing; mainly that everyone goes through 
these changes and to ask me or his father any questions he has. We have always answered 
his questions honestly and sincerely, without feeling any embarrassment.&quot; Check 
with your preteen&#39;s school to see if he&#39;ll have a class on physical changes. Sometimes 
they&#39;ll send home a booklet discussing the changes, which you can read through together.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Sometimes, of course, the physical changes can create a more serious situation than 
what the average preteen experiences, such as the development of addictions, severe 
behavioral problems, or eating disorders. For such critical issues, seek the help 
of a professional. Ask your physician or school guidance counselor for a referral.<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<b><a name="Mind"></a>Am I Losing My Mind?</b><br>
Along with the physical changes, of course, come mood swings, peer conflicts, and 
a host of other emotionally charged scenarios:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Changing friends or cliques.</b> Middle school can be a tension-filled environment. 
Bullies emerge. Fights with friends can affect schoolwork, and one-time allies may 
become enemies. Times may be tough. Know that peer groups can evolve, and keep an 
eye on new faces that may influence your child. One way to keep up? &quot;Invite your 
child&#39;s friends over — and get to know their parents too,&quot; advises a mother with 
two now-high school age kids.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Dealing with peer pressure.</b> On a daily basis, your middle schooler probably 
asks himself, <i>What&#39;s cool?</i> Doubts hatch, and he may abandon things he used 
to like because they aren&#39;t &quot;in.&quot; All this adds up to a lot of time worrying about 
image and striving to fit in. This, in turn, can easily affect his concentration, 
especially if he faces pressure on a day-to-day basis during school hours. Reinforce 
the idea that he is a wonderful individual, and should do the things that make him 
happy, not the things that are popular and make him uncomfortable. The mother from 
New York says, &quot;This is something that should be talked about from your child&#39;s 
early years, and reiterated over the years. The advice I give my son is to do what 
he knows in his heart is the right thing.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Forming beliefs.</b> With so much information flying at your child, don&#39;t be 
surprised if she starts forming her own opinions, in every aspect from politics 
to the environment, from religion to vegetarianism. Have a solid foundation for 
communicating at home. Ask her to tell you why she feels the way she does when she&#39;s 
passionate about an issue. If you keep an open mind, you&#39;ll learn a lot!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Having boyfriends/girlfriends.</b> Middle school begins the time-honored tradition 
of dating. Of course, this term is used quite loosely, as kids this age don&#39;t do 
much more than hang out and instant-message each other. &quot;I think preteens and teenagers 
are pushed into dating way too early,&quot; says one parent, citing chaperoned group 
events as a fine compromise. Another way to keep an eye on the so-called dating 
scene? &quot;Have an open home and encourage your child to host his friends — start this 
early!&quot; says one mom, who is preparing for her preteen son to being dating soon.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Developing crushes and acting on them is an important part of socialization that 
will be more refined come high school. However, these flirtations certainly take 
time away from schoolwork, and if you notice that your preteen has a case of puppy 
love, take the time to talk about it and offer advice and support.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<a href="#Top">Back to top</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b><a name="School"></a>Why Is School So Different?</b><br>
Be prepared for the effects that &quot;graduating&quot; to middle school may have on your 
child. Your preteen will have to adjust to her new school environment in the following 
ways:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Grasping the new class schedule.</b> In middle school, the class schedule evolves. 
Punctuality becomes more important; if your child is late for class, his grades 
may suffer. The adjustment to core subjects taught by different teachers, moving 
from classroom to classroom, and shorter lunch breaks can be quite stressful at 
first. Go over the importance of being on time, and treat your child to a wristwatch 
that he can synchronize with the school bell.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Tackling &quot;real&quot; homework assignments.</b> Homework now becomes more than completing 
a worksheet nightly or practicing spelling words. There is way more work, and the 
work is more difficult. Teachers stagger assignments, and your child will learn 
how to juggle daily, weekly, and monthly due dates. Help your preteen organize for 
this with tools like a homework calendar or planner. Being prepared for this particular 
change can positively affect the way she adapts and learns.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Delving deeper into subjects.</b> All of a sudden, math becomes algebra and science 
morphs into biology. With all the new components to the core subjects, you may notice 
that where your child once excelled, he might now struggle. Explore tutoring options 
for subjects in which he finds difficult or ask if he has a buddy in class that 
he can call for help. Some kids prefer working with peers, while others benefit 
from a professional tutor.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Getting to know all the teachers.</b> Realistically, the kind of rapport your 
child has with a particular teacher may influence how she performs in that subject; 
for example, if she thinks her math teacher is mean, she may shy away from math 
in favor of another subject. Likes and dislikes do shape the middle school experience, 
and your child might tend to daydream in class if she doesn&#39;t like an authority 
figure. Connect with her teachers to get an idea of what&#39;s going on, and if there 
seems to be a problem, strike up a discussion with your middle schooler. Get her 
take, and then work towards a solution.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Choosing extracurricular activities.</b> There are so many options! Talk to your 
child about the activities he wants to do, as opposed to a hobby he may have lost 
interest in but continues because he&#39;s expected to participate. You may find that 
he&#39;s lost his passion for piano, and really wants to try out for the swim team. 
And with all of the schoolwork he&#39;ll be doing, make sure he doesn&#39;t load up on too 
many extracurriculars. Let him enjoy being a kid! Even more importantly, show support 
of the choices he makes. &quot;Stay involved!&quot; says one mom, when asked what she does 
to keep her preteen on the road to school success. &quot;Go to the games, meetings, concerts. 
Show your child that you are always there for him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yes, distractions are inevitable in middle school. But if you&#39;re armed with the 
knowledge to understand why these changes affect your preteen, you can help her 
learn to enjoy her middle school adventure.<br>
