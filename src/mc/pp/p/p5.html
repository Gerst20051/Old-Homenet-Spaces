    In twilight&#39;s zone or mystery?<br>
    Reaching out from my entity.<br>

    Windows doors that didn&#39;t open<br>
    Key holes seeing into the soul.<br>
    Unlocking secrets held within.<br>
    Then closing windows once again.<br>
    <br>
    Nobody saw me, nobody wins.<br>
    The journey beyond now begins.<br>
    Life&#39;s riddles we play every day.<br>
    Asking questions of what we say.<br>
    <br>
    There are no answers only truths.<br>
    Seek it within twilights of youth.<br>

    No destiny it&#39;s only pretend.<br>

    Hiding inside~I&#39;ll be your friend.<br>
    Listening to questions over again.<br>
    Finding no answers, which you seek.<br>
    There are no answers to what you speak. <br>
    <br>
    Words made alive the way they&#39;re wrote.<br>
    Painted pictures that gets the vote.<br>
    Listen and you will hear the song.<br>
    Of your muse now humming along.<br>
    <br>
    Everything old is born again.<br>
    Ending starts over ~now begin.<br>
    Twirling around going nowhere.<br>

    Tickles me to think of it at all.<br>
    Camping out in the leaky gray old tent.<br>
    Giggling and laughing telling spooky stories in black night fall.<br>
    Midnight trips to the bathroom stumbling we went.<br>
    <br>
    Screaming and pretending to be afraid, we&#39;d flee<br>
    From my brothers who scared us all mercilessly, <br>
    Tripping in the dark, careful now don&#39;t trip.<br>
    Hurry run back to the safety of flickering orange wick.<br>
    <br>
    In my room now once again, <br>
    <br>
    Nighttime talks with my sister back then.<br>
    While I sat there and brushed her silky long brown hair<br>
    Next morning not remembering a word that was said!<br>
    Talking in my sleep instead. With secrets I kept.<br>
    <br>
    Stuffed animals scattered all over, my side of the room. <br>
    The long old dresser split down the middle to share.<br>
    Hers was neat and mine-scattered papers everywhere.<br>
    These are the memories that go through my head.<br>
    <br>
    When I was once young and lived the story told.<br>
    Each day a new adventure waiting to unfold.<br>
    Oh, how I love to color my world to this day!<br>
    In search of the little girl dreaming away.<br>
    Lost within the colors of rainbows past.<br>
    Holding onto memories that will always last.<br>

    You think you know how poets feel<br>
    When you read their words <br>
    You think they&#39;re real<br>
    They create emotions that you can&#39;t still.<br>

    Is where you find the soulful being!<br>

    <br>
    They make you happy, joyful and sad<br>
    They may be someone&#39;s mom or dad<br>
    They may be a child left alone again<br>
    They may be childless and hurt within.<br>
    <br>
    You think you find them on the page<br>

    Clothed in invisible ink behind the scene<br>
    They will make you stop and even dream.<br>

    So next time you read a poem<br>
    And you think you see, I beseech you to look within<br>
    Behind the painted dressing screen<br>

    Poets of the soul both breathe and hurt.<br>
    <br>
    They laugh and cry and even flirt.<br>
    They fall in love and break up too.<br>
    They dream and build mountains just like you!<br>

    GOD&#39;S ANSWER<br>
    <br>
    Aye yee know the play of minds games<br>
    upon the lassies fair<br>
    that which draws you in<br>
    and transforms the conscious mind<br>
    <br>
    yet tis your heart that yearns<br>
    not the lassies you saught<br>
    for you are in search of something<br>
    most of them are not.<br>
    <br>
    Your passion runs deep<br>
    the eternal flame within<br>
    burning torch that it is<br>
    flames hearts souls again.<br>
    <br>
    I am God of all things<br>
    and answer all who fall upon their knees<br>
    calling up on Me<br>
    I am the spirit of messages you release.<br>
    <br>
    Even upon the merry hill.<br>
    And yee are blessed to have called this day<br>
    for others heard the message if you did not<br>
    trust in My words that you so easily penn.<br>
    <br>
    I am the passion that drives you within.<br>
    Your imprisoned body I claim as mine.<br>
    My child, by your faith<br>
    Judge not yourself or others.<br>
    <br>
    Your gentle heart does not go unnoticed.<br>
    You give freely to those you love <br>
    Tormented to see their agony <br>
    that which you cannot escape<br>
    <br>
    Free yourself within<br>
    release your soul to forgiveness<br>
    stand tall and lean on My foundation<br>
    you know the way have you forgot?<br>
    <br>
    You will know Me by My love<br>
    that shines into the night<br>
    glowing within a world of darkness<br>
    that few can see the light.<br>
    <br>
    Go now and meditate and I will come unto you.<br>
    Did I not hear your cry in the night?<br>
    My child you know Me and mine.<br>
    Stay in the light of faith.<br>
    <br>
    There you shall find me within you!<br>

    over and over again.<br>
    Listening to his music my soul cries out in unity.<br>
    Feeling the depth of his reality.<br>
    Grasping to be held within his embrace this night.<br>
    I hear his voice sweet echoing onto me.&nbsp; <br>
    Laying here beside him feeling his breath now upon my cheek<br>
    I turn my head towards him with puckered lips.<br>
    Tracing them with my tongue savoring the softness there <br>
    while his scent fills my room with <br>
    a masculine smell of chaps aftershave and desire.<br>
    I reach out to him with a smile content knowing the feeling <br>
    of serenity when held within his warm embrace.<br>
&nbsp; And I cry out loud for the sweet agony.<br>
    Abruptly I awake and squint my eyes to see.<br>
    Looking around me in the darkness to find once again I am alone<br>
    and him a ghost within my mind.<br>
&nbsp; How does the heart bear the aloneness?<br>
    I put my arms around myself and give myself a hug.<br>
    Pulling the covers up around me<br>
    then curl up into a ball.<br>
    Tears now escaping from my eyes.<br>
    I tell myself I am not alone<br>
    and here I cry myself to sleep<br>
    to his music I heard once so bitter sweet.<br>

    Feel me oh Lord,<br>

    Know that in you I do believe.<br>
    Nothing can be hidden from the Father.<br>
    I know the way through <br>
    ~<br>
    I have been received and loved.<br>

    Block the negative.&nbsp; And follow <br>

    The key for others<br>
    it is as different and yet as alike.<br>
    Where the heart goes to feel the soul<br>
    and the spirit flies!<br>
    ~<br>
    Surrender your conscious thought <br>
    Go into the other realm of spiritual energy.<br>
    It is alive and breathes the same air<br>
    swirling around invisible and yet so easy to see. <br>
    ~<br>
    Ask in your deepest faith.<br>
    White washes your way with the brightest light.<br>
    Make way for the unknown<br>
    Open your vision and you will gain sight.<br>
    ~<br>
    Hear me oh now that will listen unafraid.<br>
    Fear not the heart that is brave.<br>
    Touched by the belief in man<br>
    but envisioned by the sacred.<br>
    ~<br>
    And mortal man but I.<br>
    Stands before you in my covered sin<br>
    and pleads over and over again.<br>
    Take me to the Holy joining.<br>

    Bath me in your cleansing<br>
    that I am worthy and protected.<br>
    From the darkness in which I live<br>
    taking me into the light of protection.<br>

    Another fight to sustain this body of life<br>

    Wearing that deep velvet flowered purple hat.<br>
