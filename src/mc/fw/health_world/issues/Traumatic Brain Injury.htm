            Traumatic brain injury (TBI), also called acquired brain injury or simply 
            head injury, occurs when a sudden trauma causes damage to the brain. 
            TBI can result when the head suddenly and violently hits an object, 
            or when an object pierces the skull and enters brain tissue.&nbsp; Symptoms 
            of a TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the extent of 
            the damage to the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; A person with a mild TBI may remain 
            conscious or may experience a loss of consciousness for a few seconds 
            or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, confusion, 
            lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in 
            the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, a change in sleep 
            patterns, behavioral or mood changes, and trouble with memory, concentration, 
            attention, or thinking.&nbsp; A person with a moderate or severe TBI 
            may show these same symptoms, but may also have a headache that gets 
            worse or does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions 
            or seizures, an inability to awaken from sleep, dilation of one or both 
            pupils of the eyes, slurred speech, weakness or numbness in the extremities, 
            loss of coordination, and increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation.</p>
