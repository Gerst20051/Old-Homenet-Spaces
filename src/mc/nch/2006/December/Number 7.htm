              NASA photographs have revealed bright new deposits seen in two gullies 
              on Mars that suggest water carried sediment through them sometime 
              during the past seven years, according to a report on the NASA website.<br>
              <br>
              &quot;These observations give the strongest evidence to date that water 
              still flows occasionally on the surface of Mars,&quot; said Michael Meyer, 
              lead scientist for NASA&#39;s Mars Exploration Program, Washington.
              <br>
              <br>
              Liquid water, as opposed to the water ice and water vapour known to 
              exist at Mars, is considered necessary for life. The new findings 
              heighten intrigue about the potential for microbial life on Mars. 
              The Mars Orbiter Camera on NASA&#39;s Mars Global Surveyor provided the 
              new evidence of the deposits in images taken in 2004 and 2005. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;The shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if 
              the material were carried by flowing water,&quot; said Michael Malin of 
              Malin Space Science Systems, San Diego. &quot;They have finger-like branches 
              at the downhill end and easily diverted around small obstacles.&quot; Malin 
              is principal investigator for the camera and lead author of a report 
              about the findings published in the journal Science. <br>
              <br>
              The atmosphere of Mars is so thin and the temperature so cold that 
              liquid water cannot persist at the surface. It would rapidly evaporate 
              or freeze. Researchers propose that water could remain liquid long 
              enough, after breaking out from an underground source, to carry debris 
              downslope before totally freezing. The two fresh deposits are each 
              several hundred meters or yards long. <br>
              <br>
              The light tone of the deposits could be from surface frost continuously 
              replenished by ice within the body of the deposit. <br>
              <br>
              Another possibility is a salty crust, which would be a sign of water&#39;s 
              effects in concentrating the salts. If the deposits had resulted from 
              dry dust slipping down the slope, they would likely be dark, based 
              on the dark tones of dust freshly disturbed by rover tracks, dust 
              devils and fresh craters on Mars. <br>
              <br>
              Mars Global Surveyor has discovered tens of thousands of gullies on 
              slopes inside craters and other depressions on Mars. <br>
              <br>
              Most gullies are at latitudes of 30 degrees or higher. Malin and his 
              team first reported the discovery of the gullies in 2000. <br>
              <br>
              To look for changes that might indicate present-day flow of water, 
              his camera team repeatedly imaged hundreds of the sites. One pair 
              of images showed a gully that appeared after mid-2002. That site was 
              on a sand dune, and the gully-cutting process was interpreted as a 
              dry flow of sand. <br>
              <br>
              Today&#39;s announcement is the first to reveal newly deposited material 
              apparently carried by fluids after earlier imaging of the same gullies. 
              The two sites are inside craters in the Terra Sirenum and the Centauri 
              Montes regions of southern Mars. <br>
              <br>
              &quot;These fresh deposits suggest that at some places and times on present-day 
              Mars, liquid water is emerging from beneath the ground and briefly 
              flowing down the slopes. This possibility raises questions about how 
              the water would stay melted below ground, how widespread it might 
              be, and whether there&#39;s a below-ground wet habitat conducive to life. 
              Future missions may provide the answers,&quot; said Malin. <br>
              <br>
              Besides looking for changes in gullies, the orbiter&#39;s camera team 
              assessed the rate at which new impact craters appear. <br>
              <br>
              The camera photographed approximately 98 percent of Mars in 1999 and 
              approximately 30 percent of the planet was photographed again in 2006. 
              The newer images show 20 fresh impact craters, ranging in diameter 
              from 7 feet (2 meters) to 486 feet (148 meters) that were not present 
              approximately seven years earlier. These results have important implications 
              for determining the ages of features on the surface of Mars. These 
              results also approximately match predictions and imply that Martian 
              terrain with few craters is truly young. <br>
              <br>
              Mars Global Surveyor began orbiting Mars in 1997. The spacecraft is 
              responsible for many important discoveries. NASA has not heard from 
              the spacecraft since early November. Attempts to contact it continue. 
              Its unprecedented longevity has allowed monitoring Mars for over several 
              years past its projected lifetime.</div>
