      Welcome to the <i>Astrological Glossary</i>. Here you will find many different 
      terms used in Astrology.<p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080">

      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Applying:</b></font> 
      When the distance between two Planets in aspect is narrowing towards an exact 
      aspect, the aspect is said to be an <i>applying</i> aspect. This is easier 
      to explain using an example: Note that the chart in </font>
      <a href="http://www.djay.com/astrol/astrol_9.html"><font color="#000080">Planets 
      in Aspect</font></a><font color="#000080"> the aspect named <i>opposition</i> 
      is defined as planets in a relationship (value) of 180 degrees from each other 
      with an orb of influence of 7. That means that if two planets are 180 degrees 
      plus or minus 7 degrees from each other they would be interpreted as being 
      in opposition, ie, they are close enough to exact to influence each other 
      in the manner of an opposition. An orb of 179 degrees would be moving <i>toward</i> 
      [applying aspect] the exact aspect value of 180 degrees and an orb of 182 
      degrees would be moving <i>away from</i> [separating aspect] the exact orb 
      of 180 degrees. This is further complicated by the fact that various astrologers 
      may use a slightly different orb of influence then the ones noted in this 
      chart.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Ascendant:
      </b></font>Follow the horizontal line on the natal chart wheel to the left 
      where it intersects with the wheel. The Zodiacal Sign located here on the 
      Cusp of the first House is the Rising Sign, and this sign and its number of 
      degrees is called the Ascendant. It represents your way of expressing yourself 
      in action. This is one of the four main <i>horoscope angles</i> of the chart 
      wheel, which are considered sensative points. These four angles are located 
      at the very leftmost point (Ascendant), the very rightmost point (Descendant) 
      , the top (Midheaven or MC), and the bottom (Nadar or IC [Imum Coli]) of the 
      chart wheel.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Aspect 
      Configurations:</b></font> Patterns of aspected Planets, such as a Stellium, 
      Grand Trine, Grand Cross, T-Square, or Yod. These patterns point to major 
      issues, talents, and challenges within one&#39;s nature.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Aspect:</b></font> 
      The angular separation between two bodies, measured along a great circle, 
      is termed Aspect. Each one of a set of specific number of degrees has an Astrological 
      name and symbol and describes a way in which the energies of the two bodies 
      influence each other. In additions, certain groups of aspects have specific 
      names (Stellium, Grand Trine, Grand Cross, T-Square, Yod, etc.). Whole books 
      have been written on this subject alone. See </font>
      <a href="http://www.djay.com/astrol/astrol_9.html"><font color="#000080">Planets 
      in Aspect</font></a><font color="#000080">. Also see <i>Applying:</i></font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Asteroids:</b></font> 
      The effects of the Asteroids have been studied, much as the effects of the 
      Planets, and they may well be the remains of an exploded planet. Ceres, Pallas, 
      Juno, and Vesta were the first four asteroids discovered, but there are hundreds. 
      This vastly complicates learning astrology, so we will simply introduce the 
      concept here and there are many books available if you wish to study them 
      in depth.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Astrological 
      Chart:</b></font> Any chart calculated for a specific time and place. A Natal 
      chart is calculated for the time and place of a person&#39;s birth: A Transit 
      chart calculates the position of the Planets at a specific time and place 
      (such as an specific event). A Progressed chart calculates the position of 
      the Planets at specific time and place and places these &quot;progressed&quot; positions 
      of the Planets within the Natal chart. This gives valuable information on 
      how the present positions of the Planets are affecting any person&#39;s unique 
      natural patterns. The intent of this guide is to present the basic concepts 
      of Astrology, so we shall only mention that there are several different methods 
      of progressing a chart. See <i>Progression:</i></font></p>

      but once you have grasped the concept the symbolic language of Astrology can 
      be experienced as an elegant language! Each single symbol or glyph carries 
      so much information.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Chart 
      Ruler: </b></font>The Planet that rules the Sign on the Ascendant of your

      affects all other parts of the chart.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Chiron:</b></font> 
      A minor Planet discovered in 1977, Chiron is located between the orbits of 
      Saturn and Uranus. It appears to be associated with expanding consciousness 
      and powers of healing.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Daily 
      Motion: </b></font>Each Planet moves at a different speed through the sky 
      and each has an average amount of movement per day. The <i>daily motion</i> 
      of Saturn is 2 degrees; Mars, 32 degrees; Moon, 12 degrees; Sun, Venus, and 
      Mercury, 1 degree.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Descendant:
      </b></font>The point in a natal chart opposite to the Ascendant. See <i>Horoscope 
      Angles</i>:</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Declination:</b></font> 
      The number of degrees a body is North or South of the Equator is its <i>declination</i>.
      <i>Parallels</i> are aspects in declination, and the effect is considered 
      to be similar to a conjunction.</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Detriment:</b></font> 
      (see below, <i>Dignity:</i>)</font></p>
      <p style="text-align: left"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1"><b>Dignity:</b></font> 
      A Planet&#39;s <i>dignity</i> basically refers to the strength of its position 
      in the chart. A Planet is strong, or said to be <i>Dignified</i>, when in 
      a sign that it rules: (See chart </font>

      It is said to be <strong>exalted</strong> when in specific signs, or to be
      <i>in its fall</i> or <i>detriment</i> when in other certain signs. The origins 
      of the principles are lost in antiquity, and thought by some astrologers to 
      be obsolete. This is beyond what we want to study now, but it helps to understand 
      the terms when they appear in something you are reading.</font></p>

      </b></font>The Natal horoscope reveals the energy patterns imprinted on us 
      at the time of birth. There are several methods by which the planetary positions 
      are moved (progressed) forward (or backward) in time, and their energy patterns 
      can be seen to activate Natal patterns. This Technique shows inner growth 
      potentials. PRIMARY PROGRESSION: One degree is added to the natal Planet&#39;s 
      position for each year of real time. SECONDARY PROGRESSION: One day&#39;s planetary 
      movement equals one year of real time.</font></p>

      The circle of the 360 degree chart is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant 
      represents an arena of experience. First equals intuition, second equals emotion 
      or feelings, third equals sensation and fourth equals thinking.</font></p>

      Planets: </b></font>When a Planet appears to move backward as seen from the 
      earth it is said to be <i>retrograde</i>. This will be marked on a Natal Chart, 
      for example, by a R after the Planet, sign, and degrees notation. The energy 
      patterns of a retrograde Planet tend to be experienced more on an internal 
      level than those experienced by direct movement.</font></p>

      The band of sky in which the Planets move is called the Zodiac. The Zodiac
