      <p>If you have ever wondered about why people have to sleep or what causes 
      dreams, then read on. In this article, you&#39;ll find out all about sleep and 
      what it does for you. </p>
      <p><b>Characteristics of Sleep</b><br>
      We all know how sleep looks -- when we see someone sleeping, we recognize 
      the following characteristics: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If possible, the person will lie down to go to sleep.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>The person&#39;s eyes are closed.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>The person doesn&#39;t hear anything unless it is a loud noise.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>The person breathes in a slow, rhythmic pattern.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>The person&#39;s <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/muscle.htm">muscles</a> 
        are completely relaxed. If sitting up, the person may fall out of his or 
        her chair as sleep deepens.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>During sleep, the person occasionally rolls over or rearranges his or 
        her body. This happens approximately once or twice an hour. This may be 
        the body&#39;s way of making sure that no part of the body or skin has its circulation 
        cut off for too long a period of time. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to these outward signs, the
      <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/heart.htm">heart</a> slows down and 
      the <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain.htm">brain</a> does some 
      pretty funky things (we&#39;ll get to this later). </p>
      <p>In other words, a sleeping person is unconscious to most things happening 
      in the environment. The biggest difference between someone who is asleep and 
      someone who has fainted or gone into a coma is the fact that a sleeping person 
      can be aroused if the stimulus is strong enough. If you shake the person, 
      yell loudly or flash a bright light, a sleeping person will wake up. </p>
      <p>For any animal living in the wild, it just doesn&#39;t seem very smart to design 
      in a mandatory eight-hour period of near-total unconsciousness every day. 
      Yet that is exactly what
      <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/evolution.htm">evolution</a> has 
      done. So there must be a pretty good reason for it! </p>
      <p><b>Who Sleeps?</b><br>
      Reptiles, birds and mammals all sleep. That is, they become unconscious to 
      their surroundings for periods of time. Some fish and amphibians reduce their 
      awareness but do not ever become unconscious like the higher vertebrates do. 
      Insects do not appear to sleep, although they may become inactive in daylight 
      or darkness. </p>
      <p>By studying brainwaves, it is known that reptiles do not dream. Birds dream 
      a little. Mammals all dream during sleep. </p>
      <p>Different animals sleep in different ways. Some animals, like humans, prefer 
      to sleep in one long session. Other animals (dogs, for example) like to sleep 
      in many short bursts. Some sleep at night, while others sleep during the day.

          to keep breathing while they sleep, so only one half of the brain sleeps

      <p><b>Sleep and the Brain</b><br>
      If you attach an <b>electroencephalograph</b> to a person&#39;s head, you can 
      record the person&#39;s brainwave activity. An awake and relaxed person generates
      <b>alpha waves</b>, which are consistent oscillations at about 10 cycles per 
      second. An alert person generates <b>beta waves</b>, which are about twice 
      as fast. </p>
      <p>During sleep, two slower patterns called <b>theta waves</b> and <b>delta 
      waves</b> take over. Theta waves have oscillations in the range of 3.5 to 
      7 cycles per second, and delta waves have oscillations of less than 3.5 cycles 
      per second. As a person falls asleep and sleep deepens, the brainwave patterns 
      slow down. The slower the brainwave patterns, the deeper the sleep -- a person 
      deep in delta wave sleep is hardest to wake up. </p>

      <p><b>REM Sleep</b><br>
      At several points during the night, something unexpected happens -- <b>rapid 
      eye movement</b> (REM) sleep occurs. Most people experience three to five 
      intervals of REM sleep per night, and brainwaves during this period speed 
      up to awake levels. If you ever watch a person or a dog experiencing REM sleep, 
      you will see their eyes flickering back and forth rapidly. In many dogs and 
      some people, arms, legs and facial muscles will twitch during REM sleep. Periods 
      of sleep other than REM sleep are know as NREM (non-REM) sleep. </p>
      <p>REM sleep is when you <b>dream</b>. If you wake up a person during REM 
      sleep, the person can vividly recall dreams. If you wake up a person during 
      NREM sleep, generally the person will not be dreaming. </p>
      <p>You must have both REM and NREM sleep to get a good night&#39;s sleep. A normal 
      person will spend about 25 percent of the night in REM sleep, and the rest 
      in NREM. A REM session -- a dream -- lasts five to 30 minutes. </p>
      <p>Medicine can hamper your ability to get a good night&#39;s sleep. Many medicines, 
      including most sleeping medicines, change the quality of sleep and the REM 
      component of it. </p>
      <p><b>When You Miss Some Zzzzs...</b><br>
      One way to understand why we sleep is to look at what happens when we don&#39;t 
      get enough: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As you know if you have ever pulled an all-nighter, missing one night 
        of sleep is not fatal. A person will generally be irritable during the next 
        day and will either slow down (become tired easily) or will be totally wired 
        because of adrenalin.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>If a person misses two nights of sleep, it gets worse. Concentration 
        is difficult, and attention span falls by the wayside. Mistakes increase.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>After three days, a person will start to hallucinate and clear thinking 
        is impossible. With continued wakefulness a person can lose grasp of reality. 
        Rats forced to stay awake continuously will eventually die, proving that 
        sleep is essential. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A person who gets just a few hours of sleep per night can experience many 
      of the same problems over time. </p>
      <p>Two other things are known to happen during sleep. Growth hormone in children 
      is secreted during sleep, and chemicals important to the
      <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/immune-system.htm">immune system</a> 
      are secreted during sleep. You can become more prone to disease if you don&#39;t 
      get enough sleep, and a child&#39;s growth can be stunted by sleep deprivation.
      </p>
      <p>But the question remains -- why do we need to sleep? Let&#39;s take a look 
      at some of the possible reasons. </span></p>

      <h1>Why Sleep?</h1>
      <p>No one really knows why we sleep. But, there are all kinds of theories, 
      including these: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sleep gives the body a chance to repair
        <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/muscle.htm">muscles</a> and other 
        tissues, replace aging or dead
        <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/cell.htm">cells</a>, etc.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>Sleep gives the <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain.htm">
        brain</a> a chance to organize and archive memories. Dreams are thought 
        by some to be part of this process.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>Sleep lowers our energy consumption, so we need three meals a day rather 
        than four or five. Since we can&#39;t do anything in the dark anyway, we might 
        as well &quot;turn off&quot; and save the energy.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>According to
        <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=sleep.htm&url=http://www.sciencenews.org/sn_arc97/5_24_97/fob2.htm">
        ScienceNewsOnline: Napless cats awaken interest in adenosine</a>, sleep 
        may be a way of recharging the brain, using adenosine as a signal that the 
        brain needs to rest: &quot;Since adenosine secretion reflects brain cell activity, 
        rising concentrations of this chemical may be how the organ gauges that 
        it has been burning up its energy reserves and needs to shut down for a 
        while.&quot; Adenosine levels in the brain rise during wakefulness and decline 
        during sleep. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What we all know is that, with a good night&#39;s sleep, everything looks and 
      feels better in the morning. Both the brain and the body are refreshed and 
      ready for a new day. </p>
      <p><b>Dreams</b><br>
      Why do we have such crazy, kooky dreams? Why do we dream at all for that matter? 
      According to Joel Achenbach in his book
      <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=sleep.htm&url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345362241/qid%3D1019146385/sr%3D1-5/ref%3Dsr%5F1%5F5/howstuffworks/104-8653053-3875141">
      Why Things Are</a>: </p>
      <ul>
        <p>The brain creates dreams through random electrical activity. <i>Random</i> 
        is the key word here. About every 90 minutes the brain stem sends electrical 
        impulses throughout the brain, in no particular order or fashion. The analytic 
        portion of the brain -- the forebrain -- then desperately tries to make 
        sense of these signals. It is like looking at a Rorschach test, a random 
        splash of ink on paper. The only way of comprehending it is by viewing the 
        dream (or the inkblot) metaphorically, symbolically, since there&#39;s no literal 
        message. </p>
        <p>This doesn&#39;t mean that dreams are meaningless or should be ignored. How 
        our forebrains choose to &quot;analyze&quot; the random and discontinuous images may 
        tell us something about ourselves, just as what we see in an inkblot can 
        be revelatory. And perhaps there is a purpose to the craziness: Our minds 
        may be working on deep-seated problems through these circuitous and less 
        threatening metaphorical dreams. </p>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some other things you may have noticed about your dreams: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dreams tell a story. They are like a
        <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/tv.htm">TV</a> show, with scenes, 
        characters and props.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>Dreams are egocentric. They almost always involve you.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>Dreams incorporate things that have happened to you recently. They can 
        also incorporate deep wishes and fears.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>A noise in the environment is often worked in to a dream in some way, 
        giving some credibility to the idea that dreams are simply the brain&#39;s response 
        to random impulses.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>You usually cannot control a dream -- in fact, many dreams emphasize 
        your lack of control by making it impossible to run or yell. (However, proponents 
        of
        <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/framed.htm?parent=sleep.htm&url=http://www.dreamviews.com/">
        lucid dreaming</a> try to help you gain control.) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dreaming is important. In sleep experiments where a person is woken up 
      every time he/she enters REM sleep, the person becomes increasingly impatient 
      and uncomfortable over time. </p>

      <p><b>How Much Sleep Do I Need?</b><br>
      Most adult people seem to need seven to nine hours of sleep a night. This 
      is an average, and it is also subjective. You, for example, probably know 
      how much sleep you need in an average night to feel your best. </p>
      <p>The amount of sleep you need decreases with age. A newborn baby might sleep 
      20 hours a day. By age four, the average is 12 hours a day. By age 10, the 
      average falls to 10 hours a day. Senior citizens can often get by with six 
      or seven hours a day. </p>
      <p><b>Tips to Improve Your Sleep</b><br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/sports-physiology.htm">Exercise</a> 
        regularly. Exercise helps tire and relax your body. </li>
        <li>Don&#39;t consume <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/caffeine.htm">
        caffeine</a> after 4:00 p.m. or so. Avoid other stimulants like
        <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/nicotine.htm">cigarettes</a> as 
        well. </li>
        <li>Avoid <a href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/alcohol.htm">alcohol</a> 
        before bedtime. Alcohol disrupts the brain&#39;s normal patterns during sleep.
        </li>

        on weekends. </li>
