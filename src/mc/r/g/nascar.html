    <div class="maincontent">
      Welcome to the <i>Nascar Glossary</i>. Nextel Cup racing, as does any other 
      professional sport, has a language all its own. The meaning and usage of the 
      terms specific to the sport pop up through any explanation of its racing action.<h3 class="pageSubHeader2">
      AERO PUSH</h3>
      <p>When following another vehicle closely, the airflow off the lead vehicle 
      does not travel across the following one(s) in a normal manner. Therefore, 
      downforce on the front of the trailing vehicle(s) is decreased and it does 
      not turn in the corners as well, resulting in an &quot;aero push.&quot; This condition 
      is more apparent on the exit of the turns. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">AERODYNAMIC DRAG</h3>
      <p>A number that is a coefficient of several factors that indicates how well 
      a race vehicle will travel through the air and how much resistance it offers. 
      Crewmen work to get the best &quot;drag horsepower&quot; rating they can, determining 
      how much horsepower it will take to move a vehicle through the air at a certain 
      mile-per-hour rate. At faster speedways teams strive to get the lowest drag 
      number possible for higher straightaway speeds. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">AIR DAM</h3>
      <p>A strip that hangs under the front grill, very close to the ground. It 
      helps provide downforce at the front of the car. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">AIR PRESSURE</h3>
      <p>With the advent of radial tires with stiffer sidewalls, changing air pressure 
      in the tires is used as another setup tool that is akin to adjusting spring 
      rates in the vehicle&#39;s suspension. An increase in air pressure raises the 
      &quot;spring rate&quot; in the tire itself and changes the vehicle&#39;s handling characteristics. 
      If his race vehicle was &quot;tight&quot; coming off a corner, a driver might request 
      a slight air pressure increase in the right rear tire to &quot;loosen it up.&quot;
      </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">BACK MARKER</h3>
      <p>A car running off the pace near the rear of the field. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">BALANCE</h3>
      <p>When a car doesn&#39;t tend to oversteer or understeer, but goes around the 
      racetrack as if its on rails, it&#39;s said to be in balance. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">BANKING</h3>
      <p>The sloping of a racetrack, particularly at a curve or a corner, from the 
      apron to the outside wall. Degree of banking refers to the height of a racetrack&#39;s 
      slope at the outside edge. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">CAMBER</h3>
      <p>Camber addresses the angle at which a tire makes contact with the track 
      surface. &quot;Positive camber&quot; indicates the angle of the tire is tilted away 
      from the vehicle&#39;s centerline while &quot;negative camber&quot; indicates the tire is 
      tilted toward the centerline. A typical oval track setup would have positive 
      camber in the left front and negative camber in the right front to help the 
      vehicle make left-hand turns. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">CAMSHAFT</h3>
      <p>A rotating shaft within the engine that opens and closes the intake and 
      exhaust valves in the engine. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">CHASSIS</h3>
      <p>The combination of a car&#39;s floorboard, interior and roll cage. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">CHASSIS ROLL</h3>
      <p>The up-and-down movement caused when a car travels around corners at high 
      speeds. The side of the car facing the turn becomes lighter while the extra 
      weight goes toward the outside of the turn. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">CONTACT PATCH</h3>
      <p>The part of the tire that&#39;s actually touching the road. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">DIRTY AIR</h3>
      <p>The air used and discarded by the lead car. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">DOWNFORCE</h3>
      <p>The air pressure traveling over the surfaces of a race vehicle creates 
      &quot;downforce&quot; or weight on that area. In order to increase corner speeds teams 
      strive to create downforce that increases tire grip. The tradeoff for increased 
      corner speeds derived from greater downforce is increased drag that slows 
      straightaway speeds. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">DRAFT</h3>
      <p>The aerodynamic effect that allows two or more cars traveling nose-to-tail 
      to run faster than a single car. When one car follows closely, the one in 
      front cuts through the air, providing less resistance for the car in back.
      </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">DRAFTING</h3>
      <p>The practice of two or more cars, while racing, to run nose-to-tail, almost 
      touching. The lead car, by displacing the air in front of it, creates a vacuum 
      between its rear end and the nose of the following car, actually pulling the 
      second car along with it. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">DRAG</h3>
      <p>The resistance a car experiences when passing through air at high speeds. 
      A resisting force exerted on a car parallel to its air stream and opposite 
      in direction to its motion. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">ENGINE BLOCK</h3>
      <p>An iron casting from the manufacturer that envelopes the crankshaft, connecting 
      rods and pistons. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">FABRICATOR</h3>
      <p>A person who specializes in creating the sheet metal body of a stock car. 
      Most teams employ two or more. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">FIREWALL</h3>
      <p>A solid metal plate that separates the engine compartment from the driver&#39;s 
      compartment of a race car. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">FRONT CLIP</h3>
      <p>The front-most part of the race car, starting with the firewall. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">FUEL CELL</h3>
      <p>A holding tank for a race car&#39;s supply of gasoline. Consists of a metal 
      box that contains a flexible, tear-resistant bladder and foam baffling. A 
      product of aerospace technology, it&#39;s designed to eliminate or minimize fuel 
      spillage. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">GROOVE</h3>
      <p>Slang term for the best route around a racetrack; the most efficient or 
      quickest way around the track for a particular driver. The &quot;high groove&quot; takes 
      a car closer to the outside wall for most of a lap, while the &quot;Low groove&quot; 
      takes a car closer to the apron than the outside wall. Road racers use the 
      term &quot;line.&quot; Drivers search for a fast groove, and that has been known to 
      change depending on track and weather conditions. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">HAPPY HOUR</h3>
      <p>Slang term for the last official practice session held before an event. 
      Usually takes place the day before the race and after all qualifying and support 
      races have been staged. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">HANDLING</h3>
      <p>Generally, a race car&#39;s performance while racing, qualifying or practicing. 
      How a car &quot;Handles&quot; is determined by its tires, suspension geometry, aerodynamics 
      and other factors. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">INTERVAL</h3>
      <p>The time-distance between two cars. Referred to roughly in car lengths, 
      or precisely in seconds. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">LAPPED TRAFFIC</h3>
      <p>Cars that have completed at least one full lap less than the race leader.
      </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">LOOSE</h3>
      <p>(Also referred to as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;oversteer.&quot;) A condition created when the 
      back end of the vehicle wants to overtake the front end when it is either 
      entering or exiting a turn. In qualifying mode teams walk a fine line creating 
      a setup that &quot;frees the vehicle up&quot; as much as possible without causing the 
      driver to lose control. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">MARBLES</h3>
      <p>(Also referred to as &quot;loose stuff.&quot;) Bits of rubber that have been shaved 
      off tires and dirt and gravel blown to the outside of a corner by the wind 
      created by passing vehicles comprise the &quot;marbles&quot; that are often blamed by 
      drivers for causing them to lose control. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">NEUTRAL</h3>
      <p>A term drivers use when referring to how their car is handling. When a 
      car is neither loose nor pushing (tight). </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">OVERSTEER</h3>
      <p>See <b>Loose</b> </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">PIT ROAD</h3>
      <p>The area where pit crews service the cars. Generally located along the 
      front straightaway, but because of space limitations, some racetracks sport 
      pit roads on the front and back straightaways. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">PIT STALL</h3>
      <p>The area along pit road that is designated for a particular team&#39;s use 
      during pit stops. Each car stops in the team&#39;s stall before being serviced.
      </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">POLE POSITION</h3>
      <p>Slang term for the foremost position on the starting grid, awarded to the 
      fastest qualifier. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">PUSH</h3>
      <p>(Also referred to as &quot;tight&quot; or &quot;understeer.&quot;) &quot;Push&quot; is a condition that 
      occurs when the front tires of a vehicle will not turn crisply in a corner. 
      When this condition occurs, the driver must get out of the throttle until 
      the front tires grip the race track again. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">QUARTER PANEL</h3>
      <p>The sheet metal on both sides of the car from the C-post to the rear bumper 
      below the deck lid and above the wheel well. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">REAR CLIP</h3>
      <p>The section of a race car that begins at the base of the rear windshield 
      and extends to the rear bumper. Contains the car&#39;s fuel cell and rear suspension 
      components. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">RESTRICTOR PLATE</h3>
      <p>An aluminum plate that is placed between the base of the carburetor and 
      the engine&#39;s intake manifold with four holes drilled in it. The plate is designed 
      to reduce the flow of air and fuel into the engine&#39;s combustion chamber, thereby 
      decreasing horsepower and speed. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">ROOF FLAPS</h3>
      <p>These flaps are sections at the rear of a race vehicle&#39;s roof that are 
      designed to activate, or flip up, if the air pressure flowing across them 
      decreases. In the case of a vehicle turning backwards, the tendency for an 
      uninterrupted flow of air is to create lift. The roof flaps are designed to 
      disrupt that airflow in attempt to keep the vehicle on the ground. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">ROUND</h3>
      <p>Slang term for a way of making chassis adjustments utilizing the race car&#39;s 
      springs. A wrench is inserted in a jack bolt attached to the springs, and 
      is used to tighten or loosen the amount of play in the spring. This in turn 
      can loosen or tighten the handling of a race car. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">SETUP</h3>
      <p>Slang term for the tuning and adjustments made to a race car&#39;s suspension 
      before and during a race. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">SHORT TRACK</h3>
      <p>Racetracks that are less than one mile in length. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">SILLY SEASON</h3>
      <p>Slang for the period that begins during the latter part of the current 
      season, wherein some teams announce driver, crew and/or sponsor changes.
      </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">SPOILER</h3>
      <p>(Also referred to as a &quot;blade.&quot;) The spoiler is a strip of aluminum that 
      stretches across the width of a race vehicle&#39;s rear decklid. It is designed 
      to create downforce on the rear of the vehicle, thereby increasing traction. 
      However, the tradeoff, again, is that more downforce equals more aerodynamic 
      drag, so teams attempt, particularly on qualifying runs, to lay the spoiler 
      at as low an angle as possible to &quot;free up&quot; their vehicles for more straightaway 
      speed. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">STAGGER</h3>
      <p>Stagger is a concept that has largely been eliminated with the use of radial 
      tires. It refers to the difference in tire circumference between the left- 
      and right-side tires on the vehicle. Typically, the left-side tires would 
      be a smaller circumference than the right-side tires to &quot;help&quot; the vehicle 
      make left-hand turns. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">STICK</h3>
      <p>Slang term used for tire traction. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">STICKERS</h3>
      <p>Slang term for new tires. The name is derived from the manufacturer&#39;s stickers 
      that are affixed to each new tire&#39;s contact surface. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">STOP &#39;N&#39; GO (BLACK FLAGGED)</h3>
      <p>A penalty, usually assessed for speeding on pit road at the appropriate 
      speed and stopped for one full second in the team&#39;s pit stall before returning 
      to the track. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">SUPERSPEEDWAY</h3>
      <p>A racetrack of one mile or more in distance. Road courses are included. 
      Racers refer to three types of oval tracks. Short tracks are under one mile, 
      intermediate tracks are at least a mile but under two miles and superspeedways 
      are two miles and longer. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">SWAY BAR</h3>
      <p>Sometimes called an &quot;antiroll bar.&quot; Bar used to resist or counteract the 
      rolling force of the car body through the turns. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TEMPLATE</h3>
      <p>A device used to check the body shape and size to ensure compliance with 
      the rules. The template closely resembles the shape of the factory version 
      of the car. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TIGHT</h3>
      <p>Also known as &quot;understeer.&quot; A car is said to be tight if the front wheels 
      lose traction before the rear wheels do. A tight race car doesn&#39;t seem able 
      to steer sharply enough through the turns. Instead, the front end continues 
      through the wall. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TOE</h3>
      <p>Looking at the car from the front, the amount the tires are turned in or 
      out. If you imagine your feet to be the two front tires of a race car, standing 
      with your toes together would represent toe-in. Standing with your heels together 
      would represent toe-out. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TRACK BAR</h3>
      <p>(Also referred to as a &quot;Panhard bar.&quot;) This bar locates the vehicle&#39;s rear 
      end housing from left-to-right under it. In calibrating the vehicle&#39;s &quot;suspension 
      geometry,&quot; raising or lowering the track bar changes the rear roll center 
      and determines how well it will travel through the corners. During races, 
      this adjustment is done through the rear window using an extended ratchet. 
      Typically, lowering the track bar will &quot;tighten&quot; the vehicle and raising the 
      track bar will &quot;loosen&quot; it. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TRAILING ARM</h3>
      <p>A rear suspension piece holding the rear axle firmly fore and aft yet allowing 
      it to travel up and down. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TRI-OVAL</h3>
      <p>A racetrack that has a &quot;hump&quot; or &quot;fifth turn&quot; in addition to the standard 
      four corners. Not to be confused with a triangle-shaped speedway, which only 
      has three distinct corners. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">TURBULANCE</h3>
      <p>Air that trails behind a race car and disrupts the flow of air to the cars 
      behind it. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">UNDERSTEER</h3>
      <p>See <b>Tight</b> </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">VALANCE</h3>
      <p>(Also referred to as &quot;front air dam.&quot;) This is the panel that extends below 
      the vehicle&#39;s front bumper. The relation of the bottom of the valance, or 
      its ground clearance, affects the amount of front downforce the vehicle creates. 
      Lowering the valance creates more front downforce. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">VICTORY LANE</h3>
      <p>Sometimes called the &quot;winner&#39;s circle.&quot; The spot on each racetrack&#39;s infield 
      where the race winner parks for the celebration. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">WEDGE</h3>
      <p>Refers to the relationship from corner-to-corner of the weight of the race 
      vehicle. Increasing the weight on any corner of the vehicle affects the weight 
      of the other three corners in direct proportion. Weight adjustments are made 
      by turning &quot;weight jacking screws&quot; mounted on each corner with a ratchet. 
      A typical adjustment for a &quot;loose&quot; car would be to increase the weight of 
      the left rear corner of the vehicle, which decreases the weight of the left 
      front and right rear corners and increases the weight of the right front. 
      A typical adjustment for a &quot;tight&quot; vehicle would be to increase the weight 
      of the right rear corner, which decreases the weight of the right front and 
      left rear and increases the weight of the left front. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">WEIGHT JACKING</h3>
      <p>The practice of shifting a car&#39;s weight to favor certain wheels. </p>
      <h3 class="pageSubHeader2">WIND TUNNEL</h3>
      <p>A structure used by race teams to determine the aerodynamic efficiency 
      of their vehicles, consisting of a platform on which the vehicle is fixed 
      and a giant fan to create wind currents. Telemetry devices determine the airflow 
      over the vehicle and its coefficient of drag and downforce.</p>
