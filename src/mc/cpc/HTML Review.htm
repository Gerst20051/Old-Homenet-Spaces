<h3>What are meta tags?</h3>
<p>The <b>Meta</b> tag in html is not a required tag when you&#39;re creating your web 
pages; many pages don&#39;t use the tag at all, and I must confess that I&#39;ve not used 
it on my home page, although I put it into this page by way of demonstration. To 
put it briefly, the meta tag is used by search engines to allow them to more accurately 
list your site in their indexes. Sometimes.<br>
If you simply produce your home page and register the URL with a search engine, 
or a number of search engines, their spider programmes will (eventually) toddle 
along to your site to index it. Now, each of the search engines does this slightly 
differently. Altavista for example will grab everything in your document and index 
it, but will only show the first 250 characters in its description. Consequently, 
if your site included say, &#39;Thanks to:....&#39; right at the beginning, this is what 
Altavista would show in its description, and it wouldn&#39;t give the viewer any idea 
of what your site actually covered. Of course, not all search engines work this 
way; I&#39;d suggest you ferret around a little bit to see exactly how the popular engines 
work, and certainly the major two or three such as Altavista, Lycos, Yahoo, Infoseek 
and Excite. It therefore makes sense to ensure that your opening paragraph is carefully 
written to ensure it accurately reflects what your site covers.<br>
However, you <b>may</b> be able to exert a certain amount of control over how your 
site is indexed by the use of the meta tag. (I should however point out that not 
all search engines will use this tag - Altavista does, but Excite doesn&#39;t, for example. 
Its not a total cure-all therefore, but you won&#39;t miss out by putting the tag in, 
and it may well work well in some cases.</p>
<h3>What does a meta tag look like?</h3>
<p>You should insert the meta tag element at the top of your document, just after 
the &lt;TITLE&gt; element. It follows the usual form of tags, ie<br>
&lt;META name=&quot;something&quot; content=&quot;something else&quot;&gt;<br>
but note that you don&#39;t have to have a &lt;/META&gt; at the end of the tag, the way that 
you do with something like &lt;BOLD&gt; <b>bold</b> &lt;/BOLD&gt;. However, make sure that each 
tag does not include any line breaks, since some search engines get a little bit 
tetchy about this.</p>
<h3>What can I include in a meta tag?</h3>
<p>There are basically four major meta tags that you can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META name=&quot;resource-type&quot; content=&quot;document&quot;&gt;
  <ul>
    <li>The only resource type that is currently in use is &quot;document&quot; This is the 
    only tag that you need to put in for indexing purposes, but use of the others 
    is a good idea. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;a description of your page&quot;&gt;
  <ul>
    <li>Depending on the search engine, this will be displayed along with the title 
    of your page in an index. &quot;content&quot; could be a word, sentence or even paragraph 
    to describe your page. Keep this reasonably short, concise and to the point. 
    However, don&#39;t be so mean with your description that its not an appropriate 
    reflection of the contents! </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;a, list, of, keywords&quot;&gt;
  <ul>
    <li>Choose whatever keywords you think are appropriate, seperated by commas. 
    Remember to include synoyms, americanisms and so on. So, if you had a page on 
    cars, you might want to include keywords such as car, cars, vehicles, automobiles 
    and so on. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META name=&quot;distribution&quot; content=&quot;one of several&quot;&gt;
  <ul>
    <li>Content should contain either global, local or iu (for Internal Use). To 
    be perfectly honest, I can&#39;t quite get my head around this one; its supposed 
    to list available resources designed to allow the use to find things easily, 
    but I still don&#39;t quite get it. My advice is to stick to &quot;global&quot;. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Are there optional tags?</h3>
<p>Yup, theres a whole bunch of &#39;em. I&#39;ve put in a couple of examples below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META name=&quot;copyright&quot; content=&quot;copyright statement&quot;
  <ul>
    <li>Pretty obvious what this one&#39;s for. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;varname&quot; content=&quot;data&quot;
  <ul>
    <li>This binds the varname to an HTTP header field. An http server might use 
    this to process a document. This one&#39;s a tad more tricky.If you included the 
    following example:<br>
    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;car,cars&quot;<br>
    then, as part of a GET command the server would include the word car and cars 
    in the HTTP response header. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0; url=homepage.htm&quot;
  <ul>
    <li>This can be used in the HEAD section of the index.html file to redirect 
    it to homepage.htm. The figure after content is the time in seconds that the 
    browser waits before moving on. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few others that you can include, such as &quot;revisit-after&quot; and &quot;rating&quot; 
if you want to be really comprehensive.</p>
<h3>Other useful points.</h3>
<p>There is no need to index every single file that you&#39;ve got on your site - just 
choose a few representative samples.<br>
The description tag should not simply restate the title of the page, it should describe 
the page.<br>
The tag can also be used in the creation of dynamic documents, and when I&#39;ve explored 
this a little bit further, I&#39;ll add more information on this.</p>
<h3>Where can I get more information?</h3>
<p>What - you mean all my hard work above isn&#39;t enough for you? OK. Some sites that 
I&#39;ve identified that might be of further use are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/META/">Dictionary of meta tags</a> 
  and a list of RFC sources
  <ul>
    <li>This is a (yuck!) frames site, but has lots of useful stuff. It gets technical 
    quickly, so be warned. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/VWbot/mk-metas.html">A meta tag builder</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Useful site which will create a set of meta tags based on information you 
    provide. Useful if you&#39;re not sure of how to do it. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/metadata.html">OCLC/NCSA Metadata 
  workshop</a>
  <ul>
    <li>This provides information on the catalogue record element known as the &#39;Dublin 
    Core&#39; which looks as though its going to be a very useful advance in the use 
    of the little beasties. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Any software to help me create meta tags?</h3>
<p>Yes, there are a few of these things about. One that I&#39;ve been told of is at
<a href="http://www.hisoftware.com/taggen.htm">http://www.hisoftware.com/taggen.htm</a>. 
I&#39;ve not tried it out myself, but it looks interesting. I&#39;m currently downloading 
a trial version, to see what its like. I&#39;ll let you know.<br>
<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/</a> 
This site will automatically try and generate meta tags based on the Dublin core 
for you. Seems to work well, though its a little enthusiastic about the number of 
keywords it generates!</p>
<h3>Questions about the meta tag</h3>
<p><b>Can I put my competitors name(s) in my meta tags?</b><br>
Sounds like a good idea when you first think of it doesn&#39;t it? I mean, if you put 
your competitors names in your meta tags, and someone searches for them, they may 
find you instead and buy a product from you, rather than them. Unfortunately, life 
isn&#39;t that simple. In the UK (where I&#39;m based) there are laws against passing yourself 
off as another company - I wouldn&#39;t get very far if I tried to open a shop called 
Harrods, for example. You&#39;ll find that putting in meta tags is probably going to 
be regarded in exactly the same way by the British courts. (Please bear in mind 
here that I&#39;m <b>not</b> a lawyer, and I&#39;m not giving legal advice; this is just 
my opinion.)<br>
I suspect that you&#39;ll find the same thing in other countries around the world, and 
you&#39;ll end up in a whole bunch of trouble if you try and do it. Of course, there 
is nothing to stop you stressing the products themselves that you sell, in common 
with that of your competitors, in your meta tags and you may find that this works 
rather better than putting in their names anyway!</p>
<p><b>Should I use commas or not?</b><br>
Some people do, some people don&#39;t. I&#39;ve yet to be convinced that either is the best 
approach. For what its worth, I do.</p>
<p><b>I use AOL, and I&#39;m having difficulty putting in meta tags. How do I do it?</b><br>
Can&#39;t help with that one, I&#39;m afraid. Since I&#39;m not an AOL person, I can&#39;t get access 
to their authoring tool, so I don&#39;t know how it works. I have had a lot of people 
asking me this one, so its a problem that a lot of people have - you&#39;re not alone! 
All I can suggest is that you contact AOL technical support and see if they can 
come up with something to help. However, I&#39;ve also had people writing to me saying 
that AOL technical staff don&#39;t know the answer themselves!<br>
Since writing this I&#39;ve had a very helpful email regarding this problem and am including 
it below; it should sort out any problems!<br>
<i>I noticed a query about AOL users including metatags in their home page. If they 
use the automated approach, they won&#39;t be able to. However, they can FTP into their 
site, following the instructions for advanced users, download the home page from 
the folder &quot;myhomepage&quot; (it will be called something like &quot;aboutme.html&quot;), open 
the file in a text editor, and insert metatags to their heart&#39;s content. They can 
then upload that file back into the folder on aol (I think that will over-write, 
without having to delete the original first).</i><br>
Many thanks Gerry!</p>
<p><b>Should I put meta tags on every page, or just meta tags on the home or index 
page?</b><br>
Put them on every page that you create and publish. The search engines will find 
all your pages and if you want to stand a good chance of them ranking your pages 
highly, you&#39;ll want to put the meta tag element on each of them.</p>
<p><b>Can I write and ask you questions about meta tags?</b><br>
Sure! If I can answer them for you I&#39;d be happy to do so. I can&#39;t always provide 
answers, but I&#39;ll do my best. Alternatively, you might like to post them to my guestbook 
page, so that everyone else can see the question/answer.</p>
<h3>If you found this page useful...</h3>
<p>Then I&#39;d encourage you to visit my <a href="http://www.philb.com/">home page</a> 
which contains a lot of other information on writing and designing web pages, searching 
the Internet and so on. I&#39;ll guarantee you&#39;ll find other material that will be useful 
to you!</p>
<h3>If you think you&#39;ve seen this information elsewhere...</h3>
<p>It&#39;s hopefully because I&#39;ve given permission for this article to be used. However, 
this isn&#39;t always the case, I&#39;m sad to say. Take a look at:<br>
<a href="http://www.web-promotion-resource-tutorials.com/tags.html">http://www.web-promotion-resource-tutorials.com/tags.html</a> 
This is a page produced by a company that likes to think that it&#39;s producing tutorials 
for web designers. What it&#39;s actually doing is stealing work from people such as 
myself and putting it onto the net as though it&#39;s their own. As you can tell - I&#39;m 
not best pleased!</p>
