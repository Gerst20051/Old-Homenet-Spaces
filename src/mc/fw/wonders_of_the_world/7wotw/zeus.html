<p>This is the statue of the god in whose honor the Ancient
<a href="http://www.olympic.org/">Olympic games</a> were held. It was located on 
the land that gave its very name to the Olympics. At the time of the games, wars 
stopped, and athletes came from <a href="http://www.city.net/countries/turkey/">
Asia Minor</a>, <a href="http://www.city.net/countries/syria/">Syria</a>,
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/index.html">Egypt</a>, and
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/italy/sicily/">Sicily</a> to celebrate the 
Olympics and to worship their king of gods:
<a href="http://messagenet.com/myths/bios/zeus.html">Zeus</a>. </p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>At the ancient town of Olympia, on the west coast of modern
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/greece/">Greece</a>, about 150 km west of
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/greece/athens/">Athens</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ancient Greek calendar starts in 776 BC, for the Olympic games are believed 
to have started that year. The magnificent temple of Zeus was designed by the architect 
Libon and was built around 450 BC. Under the growing power of ancient Greece, the 
simple <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/zeus_bw1.jpg">Doric-style 
temple</a> seemed too mundane, and modifications were needed. The solution: A majestic 
statue. The Athenian sculptor Pheidias was assigned for the &quot;sacred&quot; task, reminiscent 
of <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/louvre/paint/auth/michelangelo/">Michelangelo&#39;s</a> 
paintings at the <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sistine/0-Tour.html">Sistine 
Chapel</a>. </p>
<p>For the years that followed, the temple attracted visitors and worshippers from 
all over the world. In the second century BC repairs were skillfully made to the 
aging statue. In the first century AD, the Roman emperor Caligula attempted to transport 
the statue to <a href="http://www.city.net/countries/italy/rome/">Rome</a>. However, 
his attempt failed when the scaffolding built by Caligula&#39;s workmen collapsed. After 
the Olympic games were banned in AD 391 by the emperor Theodosius I as Pagan practices, 
the temple of Zeus was ordered closed. </p>
<p>Olympia was further struck by earthquakes, landslides and floods, and the temple 
was damaged by fire in the fifth century AD. Earlier, the statue had been transported 
by wealthy Greeks to a palace in
<a href="http://www.ege.edu.tr/Turkiye/Marmara/">Constantinople</a>. There, it survived 
until it was destroyed by a severe fire in AD 462. Today nothing remains at the 
site of the old temple except
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/zeus_debris.jpg">rocks and 
debris</a>,
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/zeus_foundation.jpg">the foundation</a> 
of the buildings, and
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/zeus_columns.jpg">fallen columns</a>.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pheidias began working on the statue around 440 BC. Years earlier, he had developed 
a technique to build enormous gold and ivory statues. This was done by erecting 
a wooden frame on which sheets of metal and ivory were placed to provide the outer 
covering. <a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/phidias.jpg">Pheidias&#39; 
workshop</a> in Olympia still exists, and is coincidentally -- or may be not -- 
identical in size and orientation to the temple of Zeus. There, he sculpted and 
carved the different pieces of the statue before they were assembled in the temple.
</p>
<p>When the statue was completed, it barely fitted in the temple. Strabo wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;.. although the temple itself is very large, the sculptor is criticized for 
  not having appreciated the correct proportions. He has shown Zeus seated, but 
  with the head almost touching the ceiling, so that we have the impression that 
  if Zeus moved to stand up he would unroof the temple.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strabo was right, except that the sculptor is to be commended, not criticized. 
It is this size impression that made the statue so wonderful. It is the idea that 
the king of gods is capable of unroofing the temple if he stood up that fascinated 
poets and historians alike. The base of the statue was about 6.5 m (20 ft) wide 
and 1.0 meter (3 ft) high. The height of the statue itself was 13 m (40 ft), equivalent 
to a modern 4-story building. </p>
<p>The statue was so high that visitors described the throne more than Zeus body 
and features. The legs of the throne were decorated with sphinxes and winged figures 
of Victory. Greek gods and mythical figures also adorned the scene:
<a href="http://messagenet.com/myths/bios/apollon.html">Apollo</a>,
<a href="http://messagenet.com/myths/bios/artemis.html">Artemis</a>, and Niobe&#39;s 
children. The Greek Pausanias wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On his head is a sculpted wreath of olive sprays. In his right hand he holds 
  a figure of Victory made from ivory and gold... In his left hand, he holds a sceptre 
  inlaid with every kind of metal, with an eagle perched on the sceptre. His sandals 
  are made of gold, as is his robe. His garments are carved with animals and with 
  lilies. The throne is decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony, and ivory.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statue was occasionally decorated with gifts from kings and rulers. the most 
notable of these gifts was a woollen curtain &quot;adorned with
<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/science/saa/saa.html">Assyrian</a> woven patterns 
and Pheonician dye&quot; which was dedicated by the Syrian king Antiochus IV. </p>
<p>Copies of the statue were made, including a large prototype at Cyrene (<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/libya/">Libya</a>). 
None of them, however, survived to the present day.
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/zeus_bw2.jpg">Early reconstructions</a> 
such as the one by von Erlach are now believed to be rather inaccurate. For us, 
we can only wonder about the true appearance of the statue -- the greatest work 
in Greek sculpture. </p>
