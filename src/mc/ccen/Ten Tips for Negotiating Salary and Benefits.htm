<h2 align="center">Ten Tips for Negotiating Salary and Benefits</h2>
<p>Whether you are interviewing for your first job, hoping to move up in your current 
career, or simply trying to bring your salary and benefits more in line with current 
industry standards, mastering the fine art of negotiation can make a huge difference 
in your professional life and career success.&nbsp; For many, it’s a tricky subject. 
But the ability to negotiate for a compensation package that accurately reflects 
what you’re worth is a skill like any other. It definitely gets easier with practice 
and increased confidence. This is one skill you literally can’t afford not to learn.</p>
<p>Here are 10 helpful tips to start you on the road to getting what you deserve 
at work:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Ask for what you want.</b> Sometimes, getting what you want is as easy 
  as simply <i>asking</i> for it. Even if you don’t get everything you’re hoping 
  for, if you fail to ask for anything, you’re guaranteed to get less than you deserve.</li>
  <li><b>Negotiate right off the bat.</b> Start negotiating from the very beginning 
  of your employment. Consider this a strategic conversation among collaborators, 
  not a dueling match between adversaries. If you are interviewing for a new job, 
  make your salary objectives clear upfront.</li>
  <li><b>Stand your ground.</b> Make it a habit never to accept the first figure 
  a prospective employer names when making a job offer. If the salary is significantly 
  lower than what you mentioned in an earlier conversation, state that while you 
  are interested in the position, the salary you first named is more in line with 
  your objectives. You should also ask if there is a signing bonus. If the answer 
  is no, request a performance review in six months.</li>
  <li><b>Get monetary promises in writing.</b> Whether you are a consultant working 
  on a short-term project or a new employee hoping to launch a lifelong career with 
  the company, get all salary and compensation agreements in writing. If the employer 
  refuses to put the agreement in writing, you are taking your chances.</li>
  <li><b>Make yourself shine.</b> If you’re thinking of asking for a raise or increased 
  benefits, work hard to go above and beyond your performance objectives. Don’t 
  wait to be handed assignments. Instead, seek out opportunities to grow in your 
  career. An exceptional employee is in a prime position to negotiate.</li>
  <li><b>Cultivate the success of your team.</b> In most companies, the more employees 
  you oversee, the higher your salary range. It goes without saying that your level 
  of success is often dependent upon the success of the people you manage. Take 
  the time to cultivate the talents and abilities of those reporting to you.</li>
  <li><b>Gauge the job’s value.</b> Perhaps you are working a second or third shift, 
  or are expected to perform tasks under dangerous circumstances, such as handling 
  chemicals. Jobs that fall into these categories deserve to have a higher pay rate 
  -- ask for it.</li>
  <li><b>Highlight extra experience.</b> Typically, more experience results in higher 
  pay and benefits. If your experience exceeds what is required for your position, 
  make sure to emphasize this. The same goes for education (when it’s relevant). 
  Additionally, if you’ve received certifications or extended professional training 
  in your field, you should expect to earn more because of it.</li>
  <li><b>See the bigger picture.</b> Understand that negotiation is a simple fact 
  of business life. The higher you advance in your career, the more important strong 
  bargaining skills become. This can include more than just salary demands; it can 
  also mean asking for key assignments that position you for your next promotion 
  and even more earning power.</li>
  <li><b>Don’t limit yourself to money.</b> In place of a salary increase, you may 
  wish to negotiate other benefits that are more important to you, such as flexibility 
  in your schedule or the option to telecommute on certain days. Decide what you 
  really want from your employer and include it in your negotiations.</li>
