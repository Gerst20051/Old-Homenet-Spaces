<H1 align=3Dcenter>Unicode/ISO 10646 World Currency Symbols</H1>
<P align=3Dcenter>Last updated: 10-May-2003</P>
<H2>General</H2>
<P>At the time of writing, it is believed that the following are the =
only world=20
currency symbols available in Unicode/ISO&nbsp;10646.=20
<P><STRONG>Notes</STRONG>=20
<OL>
  <LI>There is some disagreement amongst typographers about the =
pound/punt and=20
  lira symbols. The Pound/Punt symbol is a stylised, cursive "L" with =
one or two=20
  horizontal cross-strokes (=A3). Around&nbsp;30 years ago, the =
two-stroke form=20
  predominated in the UK, currently the one-stroke form predominates. =
The same=20
  symbol would be used in the UK to represent both Pound/Punt and Lira =
and=20
  whether the symbol has one or two cross-strokes is a matter of what is =

  available in the typeface used.=20
  <P>It is said, although no Italian typographers have yet confirmed =
this, that=20
  only the two cross-stroke version is acceptable in Italy to represent =
the=20
  Lira. Presumably they too would use the same symbol to represent the=20
  Pound/Punt.=20
  <P>Unicode has separate symbols for both the Pound/Punt and the Lira, =
and most=20
  fonts use the single cross-stroke form for the Pound/Punt and the two=20
  cross-stroke form for the Lira. However, until Unicode is =
better-supported by=20
  browsers, it may be prudent to use the Pound/Punt symbol (which is =
part of the=20
  basic HTML character set) for the Lira rather than use the correct =
Lira symbol=20
  that not everyone will be able to see, even though this risks the =
wrath of=20
  Italian purist typographers.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>The cent symbol represents $0.01.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>The mill symbol represents $0.001 and is rarely used.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>The florin symbol was actually intended for another purpose (a =
letter in=20
  an African language) but has been given a dual-r=F4le by the Unicode =
Consortium.=20
  This usage is unfortunate since the florin symbol should always be =
slanted=20
  even in fonts which are otherwise unslanted while the African letter =
should=20
  follow the slant of the font&nbsp;- font designers have to choose =
which of the=20
  two r=F4les to design this symbol for. </LI></OL>
<H2>Browsers and Unicode Capability</H2>
<P><STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> most of the Unicode symbols here require:=20
<OL>
  <LI>That your browser is <EM>capable</EM> of displaying Unicode =
characters,=20
  and=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>That you have <EM>enabled</EM> the display of Unicode characters =
(with=20
  some browsers, configuring the browser to use a Unicode font =
automatically=20
  enables the display of Unicode characters), <EM>and</EM>=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>That you have a suitable Unicode font which contains the necessary =

  characters. Although many newer browsers have Unicode capability, =
fonts which=20
  have the full range of Unicode characters are still rare. In fact, =
fonts which=20
  contain any Unicode characters other than those that are also in=20
  ISO&nbsp;8859/1 or DOS/Windows CP&nbsp;1252 are still rare.=20
  <P>On some platforms, fonts which contain Unicode characters may have =
the text=20
  "unicode" in their name. On other platforms, there may be no way of=20
  distinguishing from the name if the font contains Unicode characters =
or not=20
  (checking the size may help as a Unicode font is likely to be around=20
  25&nbsp;times the size of a non-Unicode font). </P></LI></OL>Unless =
<EM>all</EM>=20
these conditions are met, one of the following may occur:=20
<UL>
  <LI>If your browser is very old and was written before HTML was =
extended to=20
  allow Unicode characters, it may get confused or even crash (in which =
case you=20
  won't be reading this explanation).=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>If your browser is old and was written before HTML was extended to =
allow=20
  Unicode characters it may use a rather simplistic method of dealing =
with=20
  character codes greater than&nbsp;255 (the highest character code =
permissible=20
  without using Unicode). The most common behaviour in such browsers is=20
  effectively to repeatedly subtract&nbsp;256 from the character code =
until the=20
  code value is less than&nbsp;256 and display that. The other typical=20
  behaviours are to display nothing at all, a blank space, some form of =
error=20
  marker or the character numeric reference in the form =
<SAMP>&amp;#321;</SAMP>.=20

  <P></P>
  <LI>If your browser understands Unicode but it is not enabled or you =
do not=20
  have a suitable font then it may display nothing at all, a blank =
space, some=20
  form of error marker or the character numeric reference in the form=20
  <SAMP>&amp;#321;</SAMP>.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI>Even if your browser understands Unicode, you have Unicode enabled =
and you=20
  have a suitable font, it may have gaps where some of the currency =
symbols=20
  should be in which case it may display nothing at all, a blank space, =
some=20
  form of error marker or the character numeric reference in the form=20
  <SAMP>&amp;#321;</SAMP>. </LI></UL>Here is a test to see if your =
browser can=20
handle Unicode correctly: "&#321;". Examine the character in quotes at =
the end of the=20
previous sentence. If you see a capital&nbsp;L with a stroke through the =

vertical line then your browser handles Unicode. If you see a =
capital&nbsp;A=20
then your browser was written before HTML was extended to use Unicode. =
If you=20
see something else such as a black blob or other error marker, or no =
character=20
at all, then your browser can probably handle Unicode but you don't have =
a=20
suitable font. If you see two characters in the quotes, your browser is =
using=20
these as a crude representation of the character.=20
