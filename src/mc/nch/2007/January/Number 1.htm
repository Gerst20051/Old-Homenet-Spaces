              <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:14.0pt">Google promises 
              210 jobs in Lenoir</span></b></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Internet search engine giant Google Inc. announced 
              Friday plans to establish a facility in western North Carolina that 
              will employ more than 200 workers. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Google said it will spend as much as $600 million 
              to build a data center in the Caldwell County town of Lenoir. The 
              North Carolina operations will create 210 new jobs, which will have 
              an average annual salary of $48,300. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In exchange, Google stands to gain a state and 
              local incentives package that would rank among the largest in North 
              Carolina economic development history. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The state has granted Google a performance-based 
              Jobs Development Investment Grant worth as much as $4.8 million over 
              12 years. In addition, the company could save as much as $20 million 
              under the state&#39;s &quot;Tax Credits for Growing Businesses tax credit program, 
              also referred to as Article 3J tax credits, according to Department 
              of Commerce spokeswoman Deborah Barnes. The Article 3J system replaced 
              what was formerly known as the William S. Lee tax credit system.
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The amount that Google stands to gain from state 
              tax credits is dependent upon the amount of money the company pays 
              each year in taxes. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Google also will benefit from concessions made 
              by Caldwell County. Officials say the company has been granted a 100 
              percent waiver on its business property taxes over the next 30 years, 
              as well as an 80 percent waiver on real-estate taxes over the same 
              period. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Telephone calls seeking comment from Caldwell 
              County officials were not immediately returned. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To date, the largest state and local incentives 
              package totaled $242 million to Dell in 2000 in exchange for operations 
              slated to employ 1,500 workers. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:#333333">Internet search engine 
              company Google Inc. announced it is bringing more than 210 jobs to 
              Caldwell County, a region that has recently been hard hit by numerous 
              furniture factory closings. Google, a California-based public corporation, 
              plans to invest up to $600 million to build a data center in Lenoir, 
              about 70 miles northwest of Charlotte, to support the company&#39;s online 
              operations and bring new jobs to the economically hard-hit county 
              during the next four years, according to a press release from Gov. 
              Mike Easley&#39;s office. &#39;The data center we&#39;re planning to build ... 
              will help support continued growth in our online services,&#39; said Lloyd 
              Taylor, Google&#39;s director of global operations. Wages at the Caldwell 
              County facility will vary by job function, but the average salary 
              is expected to be more than $48,300 not including benefits. The county 
              average is $27,300 without benefits, according to the release. The 
              company decided to come after state and local leaders promised more 
              than $100 million in tax breaks over 30 years to win the operation. 
              It publicly confirmed its plans with local officials at meetings and 
              a reception Thursday.&nbsp; I&#39;m thrilled to have Google coming, Timothy 
              J. Rohr, a member of the Lenoir City Council told the Raleigh News 
              and Observer. But he worried about the cost. Rohr voted against incentives 
              that the city and county approved. Officials agreed to waive 100 percent 
              of Google&#39;s business property taxes and 80 percent of its real-estate 
              taxes for three decades. </span>I&#39;m philosophically opposed to economic 
              development incentive grants, he said. In my mind they&#39;re not an effective 
              way in the long run to recruit business. I think they&#39;re a good way 
              to make a splashy show to bring in a business. ... Everyone else in 
              the community is going to have to take up the slack.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Search engine giant Google Inc. plans to spend 
              $600 million to build a data center in North Carolina, state officials 
              and the company said Friday. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The so-called &quot;server farm&quot; will eventually employ 
              210 people in a region hit hard in recent years by layoffs in the 
              furniture and textile industries. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;We&#39;re absolutely thrilled to death for our community 
              and our citizens,&quot; said Lenoir Mayor David Barlow. The center will 
              be built in his city of 60,000 about 60 miles northwest of Charlotte.
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;This company will provide hundreds of good-paying, 
              knowledge-based jobs that North Carolina&#39;s citizens want,&quot; Gov. Mike 
              Easley said in a statement. &quot;It will help reinvigorate an area hard 
              hit by the loss of furniture and textile jobs with 21st century opportunities.&quot;
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The state will give the company $4.8 million 
              as part of a total incentives package that could reach more than $100

              Google. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The average annual salary at the data center 
              is expected to be $48,300, about $20,000 more than the average salary 
              in Caldwell County. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Tim Sanders, a former Caldwell County commissioner 
              who helped lead negotiations with the company, said the site for the 
              center in Lenoir already had part of the infrastructure in place.
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Officials hope the Google data center will help 
              bring more high-tech companies to the area. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;We still have good furniture jobs here and we 
              hope to continue to grow those, but we&#39;re also diversifying in high 
              tech, Sanders said. </p>

              gave Dell Inc. $280 million worth of incentives to build a computer 
              plant in Winston-Salem. The Dell plant opened in October 2005.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Welcome to the future.<br>
              <br>
              A new era dawned for Caldwell County Thursday with the announcement 
              by global Internet leader Google that it plans to build a large-scale 
              computer data center in Lenoir.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In confirming the development plans, officials 
              from Google braved a bit of winter weather to meet with a host of 
              local business, civic and academic leaders. Google&#39;s selection of 
              Lenoir comes after being wooed for the past 13 months, which included 
              countless meetings, top-secret negotiations and unprecedented economic 
              incentives.<br>
              <br>
              “It really wasn&#39;t the incentives, per se,” Google Senior Leader Rhett 
              Weiss said. “Lenoir had some fine infrastructure installed at one 
              point for the furniture industry.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="detail-story1">“The city, county 
              and the EDC (Caldwell County Economic Development Commission) had 
              a fine team to work with us on the project.”</span><br>
              <br>
              <span class="detail-story1">According to Google&#39;s Director of Global 
              Operations Lloyd Taylor, the company plans initially to construct 
              a single, one-story building to house its massive banks of computer 
              servers. He said there is the possibility of adding additional buildings 
              to the campus in the future.</span> <br clear="all">
&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“It would depend on demand for our services,” 
              Taylor said. “It&#39;s an open question for us. Weiss said Google has 
              taken ownership of more than 220 acres of property located in the 
              Overlook Drive and Virginia Street area previously procured by the 
              Caldwell County EDC, LLC. The company also will maintain long-term 
              options to purchase additional land behind the Bernhardt Furniture 
              Company headquarters. Google also granted an option back to Duke Energy 
              in the development area if there is a need to provide additional power 
              capacity, Weiss said.<br>
              <br>
              Grading in the project area has been ongoing since early October, 
              following several months of property acquisition dating back to June. 
              Taylor said he anticipates construction to begin in a few months, 
              employing 200 to 400 people during the 12- to 18-month building phase.
              <br>
              “I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever built a data center that turned out exactly 
              how I thought it would.” We&#39;ll start with one and see what the future 
              holds.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Taylor emphasized the company&#39;s intention to 
              hire local residents once the site becomes operational. He said the 
              company likely will hire 100 people initially, including 10 to 20 
              systems analysts and 50 to 75 hardware technicians. Google will seek 
              college-educated workers for the systems analyst jobs, and hopes to 
              retrain skilled laborers that had worked in local factories for other 
              positions, Taylor said.<br>
              <br>
              A separate workforce level will involve subcontracted support staff, 
              including security, maintenance, grounds keeping and catering. Many 
              of Google&#39;s incentives are tied to an investment goal of $600 million 
              and the creation of 210 jobs.<br>
              <br>
              “Our goal is to hire locally,” Taylor said. “It&#39;s just good business.”<br>
              <br>
              Taylor, Weiss and East Coast Regional Manager Andy Johnson visited 
              Caldwell Community College and Technical Institute (CCC&amp;TI) as part 
              of the day&#39;s activities. Johnson, who visited the planned construction 
              site for the first time Thursday, is expected to oversee development 
              operations.<br>
              <br>
              “You are coming at a most opportune time,” CCC&amp;TI President Ken Boham 
              said. “There is a workforce here that is ready to go to work.<br>
              <br>
              “Furniture has been our heritage, but education is our future.”<br>
              <br>
              Appalachian State University Chancellor Ken Peacock offered his support 
              in gearing academic programs for Google.<br>
              <br>
              “We are here to find out how we can meet (Google&#39;s) needs,” Peacock 
              said. “We look forward in learning how Appalachian State can work 
              with Caldwell (Community College) to meet your expectations.”<br>
              <br>
              The two colleges recently culminated a partnership last year that 
              resulted in Appalachian State University courses being offered on 
              the CCC&amp;TI campus in Hudson. Having both institutions available for 
              training opportunities will be important to Google.<br>
              <br>
              Taylor said when he worked at a previous technology company he helped 
              the University of Maryland develop a four-year degree program focused 
              on computer information systems.<br>
              <br>
              “It&#39;s not a matter of how smart you are, it&#39;s what you can do,” Taylor 
              said. “A lot of what Google is about is enabling. We want to enable 
              people to do what they want to do.”<br>
              <br>
              Google&#39;s entry is a major boost for a county that has been devastated 
              economically by the loss of furniture jobs. The unemployment rate, 
              after soaring above 13 percent in 2005, still remains the second highest 
              in the state at 8.4 percent through November.<br>
              <br>
              In landing Google, Caldwell County and the City of Lenoir granted
