<hr>
<p align="left">Just as poets use a variety of techniques to express themselves, 
their written poetry can fall into one or more categories. Three of these 
categories are described below.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>LYRIC POETRY</b></i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than two thousand years ago in Greece, 
short poems called <i><b>lyrikos</b></i> were sung to the accompaniment of a 
lyre, a stringed musical instrument. Even when the poems were no longer sung, 
the name <b><i>lyric</i></b> remained.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyric poetry is poetry whose sole purpose is 
to express the poet's personal feelings, attitudes, or reactions. The subject of 
the poem may be anything about witch the poet has strong feelings. Subjects may 
include emotions, a scene, an idea, a person, or an event. A lyric poem will 
often appeal to the readers' senses through figurative language and imagery. 
Lyric poems may take any form.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>NARRATIVE POETRY</b></i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early narrative poems grew out of the need 
for entertainment (song) and for a means of &quot;recording&quot; and communicating 
important events or occurrences. Before witting and printing became common, 
narrative poems were often composed and sung by ordinary, uneducated people.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Narrative poetry is poetry that tells a 
story. The story may be long and complicated, with many characters involved in 
numerous events, or it may be brief, with one character in conflict with another 
or with a situation. Narrative poems are similar to short stories in that they 
have a setting, plot, and characters, and usually have dialogue. Narrative poems 
may be rhymed or unrhymed and may be organized in a variety of forms.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>DRAMATIC POETRY</b></i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dramatic poetry is poetry in which one or 
more characters speak to others who may or may not answer. The <i><b>dramatic 
monologue</b></i> is a type of dramatic poetry in which a speaker talks to a 
listener who does not speak. In dramatic poetry, the speaker generally reveals 
more about him or herself than in narrative poetry. A dramatic poem may be 
serious or humorous in nature and may take any form.</p>

      want to hurt u baby Girl: *thinks* omg I hope he doesn&#39;t break up with me... 
      I love him so much Boy: baby are you there?? Girl: yea I&#39;m here what is so 
      important?? Boy: I&#39;m not sure if I should say Girl: well u already brought 
      it up, so please just tell me. Boy: I&#39;m leaving.... Girl: baby what are u 
      talking about?? I don&#39;t want u to leave me, I love you Boy: not like that, 
      I mean I&#39;m moving far away Girl: why? All of your family lives over here. 
      Boy: well my father is sending me away to a boarding school far away. Girl: 
      I cant believe this. [FATHER: (picks up the other phone, interrupts &amp; yells 
      furiously) Erika, what did I tell you about talking to boys?!!!!!....Get off 
      the damn phone!! (And hangs up)] Boy: wow your father sounds really mad Girl: 
      u know how he gets, but anyway I don&#39;t want you to go Boy: would you run away 
      with me? Girl: baby, u know I would, I would do anything for u, but I cant... 
      U don&#39;t know what would happen if I did. My dad would kill me !! Boy: *sad* 
      its ok I understand I guess.. Girl: *thinking* I cant believe what&#39;s going 
      on Boy: I need to give u something 2nite b/c I am leaving on flight 1-80 in 
      the morning, so I need to see you now. Girl: ok I will sneak out &amp; meet u 
      at the park Boy: ok ill meet u there in 20min [They meet at a nearby park, 
      they both hug each other. And he gives her a note.] Boy: here u go, this is 
      for you I got to go. Girl: *tear* (begins to cry) Boy: baby don&#39;t cry, u know 
      I love you...but I have 2 go Girl: ok (begins to walk away) [They both go 
      back home. And Erika begins to read the letter he gave her] It says..... Erika, 
      U probably already know that I&#39;m leaving, I knew this would be better if 
      I 
      wrote a letter explaining the truth about how much I care about you. The truth 
      is, is that I never loved you, I hated you so much, u are my bitch and don&#39;t 
      u ever forget that. I never cared about you, and never wanted to talk to you, 
      n be around u. U really have no clue how much I hate you. Now that I am leaving 
      I thought u should know that I hate you bitch, u never did the right thing, 
      and u were never there. I didn&#39;t think I could hate someone as much as 
      I hate 
      you. And I never want to see you, for the rest of my life, I will never miss 
      kissing you like before, I never want to cuddle up, how we used to. I will 
      not miss you and that&#39;s a promise. U never had my love, and I want you to 
      remember that. Bitch u keep this letter because this may be the last thing 
      u have from me. I hate you so much. I will not talk to you soon bitch.... 
      Goodbye - Kyle [ Erika begins to cry, she throws the paper in the garbage 
      &amp; cries for hours ] ....A day passes, she is sad, depressed and she feels 
      so lonely.... Then she gets a phone call.... Friend: how are u feeling? Girl: 
      I just cant believe this happened I thought he loved me. Friend: o, about 
      that. Kyle left me a msg. A few days ago. He told me to tell u to look in 
      your jacket pocket or something... Girl: ummm ok [She finds a piece of paper 
      in the jacket, It says...] Baby I hope u find this before u read my letter. 
      I knew your dad might read it, so I switched a few words... Hate = Love Never 
      = Alwayz Bitch = Baby Will not= will ........ I hope u didn&#39;t take that seriously 
      because I love you with all my heart, and it was so hard to let you go that&#39;s 
      y I wanted u to run away with me... -Kyle] Girl: omg its a letter, Kyle does 
      love me!!, he must of slipped it into my pocket when he hugged me. I cant 
      believe how stupid I am!! Friend: lol ok but I g2g... Call me later Girl: 
      *happy*ok bye, I&#39;ll be at home waiting for my baby to call me !! ...... Erika

      she kills herself, because of the fact that Kyle was dead &amp; she had nothing

      <td width="100%" align="center"><font color="#0000FF">1) 94% of men lie about 
      their penis size. According to condom manufacturers, only 6% of men use extra 
      large condoms. 2) The average man is 5 inches long when erect (no matter what 
      you have heard ladies, that&#39;s the truth). 3) 80% of American men are circumcised. 
      Even though Pediatrics say it is not necessary. 4) No matter what all the 
      ads say, nothing can make your penis grow but time (most men reach the end 
      of their growth by the early 20&#39;s) 5) There is no correlation between penis 
      size and shoe size, hand size, or nose size. 6) Blue balls does exist! It&#39;s 
      technically called &quot;prostatic congestion.&quot; 7) Only 16% of men shave their 
      privates. +Some stuff on the ladies+ ------------------------------ 1) Only 
      9% of women around the globe consider themselves &quot;attractive&quot; (20% of British 
      women do). 43% of women use the term &quot;natural&quot;, 24% say they have &quot;average&quot; 
      looks, 8% prefer the term &quot;feminine&quot;, 7% say they are &quot;good looking&quot;, and 
      7% say they are &quot;cute&quot;, and finally only 2% of women say they are &quot;sexy&quot;. 
      2) An estimated 85% of women wear the wrong size bra. 3) 60% of women have 
      had breast implants. 4) 75% of women don&#39;t like oral sex 5) 95% of women shave 
      their privates. +Both+ -------------------------------- 1) Masturbation is 
      healthy for both men and women. 2) 70% of highschoolers have had sex before 
      they have graduated. 27% loose their virginity senior prom night. Only 3% 
      wait until marriage. 3) 95% of men would have sex with a girl after 1 month 
      of dating. Only 10% of women feel this way. +5 Reasons Why Sex is Good+ --------------------------------------------- 
      1) It is a good workout. Sex burns about 150 calories every half an hour of 
      it. It will lower your cholesterol and improve breathing circulation. 2) You 
      won&#39;t get sick. According to research if you have sex 1-2 times a week you 
      are less likely to get sick. 3) You&#39;ll feel happier. You will feel a greater 
      sense of well-being. Women who have more sex were clinically proven to be 
      less depressed than women who don&#39;t have sex. 4) Makes you look better - [ 
      problem is, ugly people don&#39;t get any ]. Sex releases hormones in you which 
      make your skin and hair softer and shinier and tone your physique. 5) (The 
      best reason) You will live longer. Studies prove that sex makes you live longer. 
      Men who had sex 1-2 times a week had half the death rate as those who did 
      not indulge themselves at least once a month. It also makes you look younger. 
      If you have sex 3 times a week you may look up to 10 years younger than you 
      really are. Did You Know? ---------------------------------------- 1) Having 
      sex 3 times a week for 1 year adds up to running 75 miles!!!!</font></td>

      American Dental Association says semen cuts plaque and tartar by 77%. Suck 
      a dick and save a smile... If u have sex 365 times a year and you melted down 
      all the condoms to make a tire what would u call it? a fucking Goodyear! Sex 
      is like playing spades. If u don&#39;t have a good partner, u better have a good 
      hand. Big Bad Wolf told little red riding hood lift your top so I can suck 
      your tits. no, she said while lifting her skirt, eat me like the fucking book 
      says! A rooster and a cat were playing by the pool. the cat fell in and the 
      rooster laughed. The cat said, a wet pussy always makes a cock happy! Girls 
      have unique magic tricks, they get wet without water, bleed without injury, 
      and make boneless things hard.</td>
