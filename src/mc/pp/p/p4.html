            As I gaze across the country side<br>
            Of cleared corn fields from summer&#39;s harvest.<br>
            Anticipating <br>
            The chill of winter to come,<br>
            I find closure here in the painted falling leafs<br>
            Bringing an end to summer&#39;s delights<br>
            And the warmth of<br>
            Sunshine kisses.<br>
            The beginning of winter&#39;s purity,<br>
            Brings a sense of calmness to me<br>
            As I reminisce on summers accomplishments and<br>
            The joy of another season with it&#39;s changing crayon colors<br>

            Twirling around and letting go~<br>
            There you are where ever you land. <br>
            Fun to go to this place of play land.<br>
            Listening to the waif within<br>
            Playing the elfin&#39;s flute once again.<br>
            The melody drawing you to dance within<br>
            Sucking you into the components of sound. <br>
            Rhyme and meter~flow and roll~ing along.<br>
            The main ingredients of the poetic form<br>
            You can hear their music in the words they speak.<br>
            Soft and flowing beauty~oh so deep.<br>
            They tip toe in on the fluted waves.<br>
            Making you feel all warm and dazed.<br>
            Stealing your dreams and hopes.<br>
            Displaying them on the pages for folk.<br>
            Pixies enlightening your soul~telling words where to go<br>
            On a Merry Go Round until they are all found.<br>
            Disappearing into the land of enchantment dreams.<br>
            Within the hearts soul of fantasy~<br>
            Good-bye my sweet little pixies~<br>
            Good-bye my sweet el-fin&#39;s of poetry.<br>
            Sweet music plays within the waif&#39;s calling.<br>

            <b>WHO AM I?<br>
            <br>
            </b>&quot;Who are you&quot;, he said to me.&nbsp; &#39;Who are you trying to be?&quot;<br>
            I said,&quot;me!&quot; I just want to be me.&quot;<br>
            But he did reply. &quot; I like you for who you are.&quot;<br>
            I said, &quot;I know and that&#39;s just fine,<br>
            But others have their doubt.<br>
            They do not see me inside looking out.<br>
            I just want to be me.&quot; <br>
            &quot;I don&#39;t understand who it is you want to be?<br>
            Please explain it to me then.&quot;<br>
            &quot;Me, I said, &quot; I just want to be me.<br>
            Why won&#39;t they just let me be me?&quot;<br>
            They think you can cope with life that way.<br>
            But that is a slow way of dyeing.<br>
            And you loose whom you really are inside.<br>
            I just want to be me.&nbsp; It&#39;s so simple don&#39;t you see?&quot;<br>
            &quot;I&#39;m not asking much really. <br>
            I just want to be who I am and free.<br>
            Free to look pretty if I want or go on a treasure hunt.<br>
            Free to open and close the doors without them shutting me out. <br>
            I want to be able to pick up the phone<br>
            And call you just because <br>
            And not have to explain all the people that I love.<br>
            To hold my head high and not stick it in a hole<br>
            Like gophers do. <br>
            To make plans and dreams and wishes come true.<br>
            I want to be in control don&#39;t you see?<br>
            I just want to be me.<br>
            I don&#39;t want to control you only me!<br>
            There&#39;s a difference don&#39;t you see?<br>
            They think they know me. But they don&#39;t see who I am.<br>
            They all judge me and condemn. <br>
            Hell I don&#39;t even have but one friend.&quot;<br>
            I just want to be me.&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder<br>
            What it would be like. Who then would I be?<br>
            Would I be very different if I was really me?<br>
            Perhaps that isn&#39;t reality.&nbsp; <br>
            Or maybe a mirage I conjured up in me.<br>
            But I am thirsty to be all that I am.<br>
            And all that I am to become<br>
            But I can&#39;t be the who you think I am anymore.<br>
            I have to be me. Don&#39;t you see?&quot;<br>
            It&#39;s killing me softly not knowing how <br>
            And if I can be who I am.<br>
            And in the end he said to me.<br>
            &quot;I still don&#39;t understand who you want to be?&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot; But don&#39;t change who you are.&nbsp; <br>
            You have a caring and warm heart<br>
            And you are a good person and friend.<br>
            Don&#39;t let them all suck you in.&quot;<br>
            And I thought that is who I am! <br>
            It&#39;s all I ever wanted to be.&nbsp; Me! <br>
            <br>

            Alone in nights darkening!<br>
            And there I found the oneness<br>

            Surely our grains of time have passed<br>
            Somewhere before in the night<br>

            With the colors of the universe unfolding<br>

            Help me to see photographs of time.<br>
            Ancient now we go in the past.<br>
            Old black and white photo&#39;s we thought would last.<br>
            Put in a box under mom&#39;s bed.<br>
            Most of those relatives already dead!<br>
            ~<br>
            Looking now in dresser drawer.<br>
            Photos of me in color I see more<br>
            polaroid pictures that capture moments in time<br>
            they tell a story to the knowing mind.<br>
            ~<br>
            One I was on my very first tryke.<br>
            Training wheels under me<br>
            down the hill I went and into a tree.<br>
            All banged up with bandaged knee.<br>
            ~<br>
            One with my rag doll<br>
            that I called Marie Ann<br>
            she was my secret friend.<br>
            playing until day&#39;s end.<br>
            ~<br>
            I sat in grandpa&#39;s lap so proud<br>
            and smiled into his face.<br>
            I could see the love there<br>
            That time couldn&#39;t erase.<br>
            ~<br>
            I would play with his mustache<br>
            that pricked my fingers<br>
            and made me laugh silly<br>
            like granddaughters do.<br>
            ~<br>
            Then my graduation<br>
            all grown up through school<br>
            reality setting in now<br>
            child hood dreams put back in place.<br>
            Now I sit with pictures in my mind.<br>
            And feelings of those special times<br>
            thankful for my memories<br>
            Kodak moments and child hood rhymes.<br>

            They are shallow and going nowhere. <br>
&nbsp;I strive for life in the experiences I share. <br>
            Living in an asylum where nobody cares. <br>
&nbsp;I am illusive and sometimes go unseen.&nbsp; <br>
            Yet I am but a screen of your imagination. <br>
            Some of you know the way through the mesh. <br>
            But many of others have only regrets. <br>
&nbsp;This is so sad to think that you know the secrets of life. <br>
            In truth you are in the darkness of night. <br>
            You will look for the light and won&#39;t see it there. <br>
&nbsp;For you already think you are there.&nbsp; <br>
            Beware the trouble that your darkness brings. <br>
&nbsp;It is what controls you on earth, the human beings.<br>
            .&nbsp; The light is Holy and reaches out to you. <br>
            But you must get to it and then all the way through. <br>
            Stretch your minds imagination.&nbsp; <br>
            Open your soul to listen to His voice. <br>
            Pray for His protection in His guiding light. <br>
            He&#39;s running through me and you. <br>
            The switch is on and it powers through.&nbsp; <br>
            Those who believe will all get through.&nbsp; <br>
            We are chosen and destined to be.&nbsp; <br>
            The children of the light with the power of He.&nbsp; <br>
            Block the negative and ride the wave.&nbsp; <br>
            FIght for your spirit and be reborn. <br>
            Carry a torch of light where ever yee go.&nbsp; <br>
            Call upon Him and watch and behold.&nbsp; <br>
            Just believe in your faith what ever that be.&nbsp; <br>
            And pray in His light to protect thee. <br>
            He will come in a wisp that you won&#39;t even see.&nbsp; <br>
            He is most powerful over you and me. <br>
            Loving and kind he is. <br>
            Be yee safe now in His grace. <br>
&nbsp;The clock will not turn back only go forward and spring.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Not many will reach this level of connection.<br>
&nbsp; For they have too much hesitation.<br>
&nbsp; Block the negative with his Holy light. <br>
&nbsp;Replace the negative with the positive light. <br>
            Turn the negatives into positives and you will see. <br>
&nbsp;It is God working miracles through thee. <br>
&nbsp;Say believe in what and how you do. <br>
            Believe with all your heart that it is true. <br>
            He does not limit us in our faith. <br>
            Just strive to get to the lighted gate. <br>
&nbsp;The darkness will never win over me.<br>
&nbsp; For I know I have been set free in He. <br>
&nbsp;He will be there with the force of electricity and waves. <br>
            Traveling through the space. Follow me and you will see.<br>
&nbsp; God works through you and me. <br>
            You will know him to be by your faith. <br>
            Pray for His protection in the light.<br>
&nbsp; And get ready to fight. <br>
            Call upon the angels also in your time of need<br>
            .&nbsp; And call upon the spirits of nature and buffalo and such.
            <br>
&nbsp;They are all here with us today.&nbsp; And they can build your spirit too.
            <br>

            and what beautiful music they played.<br>
            A bubbling brook, the crackling of a campfire<br>
            the crickets echo in the night. And it doesn&#39;t stop there.<br>
            Who&#39;s to say what song is playing and where? <br>
            I may be doing the waltz, while you are twisting.<br>

            The smell of homemade bread and apple pie,<br>

            What it feels like to touch something<br>
            Hot for the first time.<br>
            <br>
            And how many licks are in a lollypop.<br>

            <br>

            Round and round the mulberry tree.<br>
            Duck-duck gray duck.<br>
            Ashes to ashes they all fall down.<br>
            Here we go round the merry go round.<br>

            Touching the inner child in me.<br>

            I&#39;d never been. Or climb the tallest tree<br>
            That I could see through you<br>
            and could see through me.<br>
            <br>
            Or that poetry was therapy<br>
            now I dance for humanity,<br>
            for dignity and my reality. <br>
            To the blues when I&#39;m lonely<br>
            to set my soul free<br>

            </b>Beyond the sacred hills,<br>
            Where the land reaches up<br>
            To touch the sky<br>
            Lye the rich valleys,<br>
            <br>
            Escalating down into<br>
            Earthquake like crevices!<br>
            <br>
            Beyond the red clay hills,<br>
            Where God&#39;s creatures graze on<br>
            Nature&#39;s great trough<br>
            Lye&#39;s the magnificent pencil pine!<br>
            <br>
            Cascading down the hillside<br>
            Creating nature&#39;s great wall.<br>
            Yes, beyond the sacred hills<br>
            Our spirits entwine lifting us up<br>
            <br>
            To kiss the South Dakota sky!!<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            </b>Laughing and talking being you and me<br>
            That was the solid base of our relationship.<br>
            And I stop to ponder on what went wrong.<br>
            And I&#39;ve come up with the answer that was there all along.<br>
            <br>
            Like the breeze in a hurry to be on it&#39;s way.<br>
            Or the leaf that got caught up in it and couldn&#39;t stop to play.<br>
            No time to pick up the phone and say<br>
            How do you do or I&#39;ve been thinking of you. <br>
            <br>
            No time to send an email.&nbsp; With a short note,<br>
            No time to share no time to spare. Leaving me hanging out there.<br>
            On the face of the empty window screen<br>
            Leaving me lonely once again.&nbsp; I&#39;m ashamed to call you friend.<br>
            <br>
            What kind of friend can you be?&nbsp; I was misguided by the fantasy.<br>
            It never was my reality.<br>
            For you are the tumbleweed blowing in the wind.<br>
            And I the tree that got in the way<br>
            <br>
            But only for a slight moment did I slow you down.<br>
            For you found your way around<br>
            Me as you always do. And I am feeling the fool.<br>
            I stop to ponder and reminisce on what was shared long ago.<br>
            <br>
            You were an illusion after all.<br>
            For you had no time for me.&nbsp; Like a single rock under a tree<br>
            I had no company.&nbsp; And you just kept tumbling along.<br>
            I could hear our laughter carried away with the wind.<br>
            <br>
            But in the beginning weren&#39;t we friends??<br>

            Skipping along now here we go.<br>

            Giggling on a teeter totter.<br>
            Round and round we get louder.<br>
            Faster and faster our heads spin.<br>
            Nobody is lost but nobody wins.<br>
            <br>
            Blue is the color of our energy<br>
            The kind inside us that sets us free!<br>
            Flying off now on the ground.<br>
            Thump! Thump! Thump!...Ouch!<br>

            No more clowning around.<br>
            Play-day&#39;s once lost, now are found!<br>
            Snap, snap--I took a picture of you.<br>
            Oh no, your still blue.<br>
            <br>
            Magic and rhyme keeps us in line.<br>
            Takes us to this magical time<br>
            Off to smurf-land now to dream!<br>
            When you awaken you&#39;ll be a human being!<br>
