<p>The following is the complete text of the Constitution of the People's
Republic of China, as adopted on December 4, 1982. The electronic text was
acquired from the <a href="http://wiretap.spies.com">The Wiretap Electronic
Text Archive</a> and was marked up for Web display by <a href="sjjm.html">Steve
Mount</a>. If you are aware of any changes to the Constitution that are not
reflected on this page, please <a href="mailtowm.php3">let us know</a>.
Amendments were found on an <a
href="http://english.people.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html">official
Chinese Web Site</a>.</p>

<p>The Constitution of China is presented for comparison purposes with that of
the <a href="const.html">United States</a>.</p>

<hr title="Definitions">

<p>The only term I came across that was unknown to me is "Procuratorate."  A
procuratorate is a part of the judiciary that actually enforces laws. They are
the equivalent of prosecutors in the United States, except that they have
special constitutional status.</p>

<p>The first version of the Chinese constitution presented here was that of
December 4, 1982. The constitution's First Amendment was approved on April 12,
1988. The Second Amendment was approved on March 29, 1993. The Third Amendment
was approved on Marh 15, 1999. The Fourth Amendment was approved on March 14,
2004. This electronic copy is as correct a reproduction of the 2004 version as
possible. All amendments have been incorporated into the text.</p>

<h2>The Constitution of the People's Republic of China</h2>

<h3><a name="Preamble">Preamble</a></h3>

<p>China is a country with one of the longest histories in the world. The
people of all of China's nationalities have jointly created a culture of
grandeur and have a glorious revolutionary tradition.</p>

<p>After 1840, feudal China was gradually turned into a semi-colonial and semi-
feudal country. The Chinese people waged many successive heroic struggles for
national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom.</p>

<p>Great and earthshaking historical changes have taken place in China in the
20th century.</p>

<p>The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal
monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. But the historic mission of
the Chinese people to overthrow imperialism and feudalism remained
unaccomplished.</p>

<p>After waging protracted and arduous struggles, armed and otherwise, along a
zigzag course, the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Communist
Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader ultimately, in 1949,
overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, won a
great victory in the New-Democratic Revolution and founded the People's
Republic of China. Since then the Chinese people have taken control of state
power and become masters of the country.</p>

<p>After founding the People's Republic, China gradually achieved its
transition from a New-Democratic to a socialist society. The socialist
transformation of the private ownership of the means of production has been
completed, the system of exploitation of man by man abolished and the socialist
system established. The people's democratic dictatorship held by the working
class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is in essence
the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated and developed. The
Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have defeated
imperialist and hegemonist aggression, sabotage and armed provocations and have
thereby safeguarded China's national independence and security and strengthened
its national defense. Major successes have been achieved in economic
development. An independent and relatively comprehensive socialist system of
industry has basically been established. There has been a marked increase in
agricultural production. Significant advances have been made in educational,
scientific and cultural undertakings, while education in socialist ideology has
produced noteworthy results. The life of the people has improved
considerably.</p>

<p>Both the victory of China's new-democratic revolution and the successes of
its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all
nationalities under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the
guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and by upholding truth,
correcting errors and overcoming numerous difficulties and hardships. China will
stay in the primary stage of socialism for a long period of time. The basic task
of the nation is to concentrate its efforts on socialist modernization by
following the road of Chinese-style socialism. Under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the important thought of the "Three
Represents," the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to
the people's democratic dictatorship, follow the socialist road, persist in
reform and opening-up, steadily improve socialist institutions, develop a
socialist market economy, advance socialist democracy, improve the socialist
legal system and work hard and self-reliantly to modernize industry,
agriculture, national defense and science and technology step by step, promote
the co-ordinated development of the material, political and spiritual
civilizations to turn China into a powerful and prosperous socialist country
with a high level of culture and democracy.</p>

<p>The exploiting classes as such have been abolished in our country. However,
class struggle will continue to exist within certain bounds for a long time to
come. The Chinese people must fight against those forces and elements, both at
home and abroad, that are hostile to China's socialist system and try to
undermine it.</p>

<p>Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China. It
is the inviolable duty of all Chinese people, including our compatriots in
Taiwan, to accomplish the great task of reunifying the motherland.</p>

<p>In building socialism it is essential to rely on workers, peasants and
intellectuals and to unite all forces that can be united. In the long years of
revolution and construction, there has been formed under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China a broad patriotic united front which is composed of the
democratic parties and people's organizations and which embraces all socialist
working people, all builders of socialism, all patriots who support socialism
and all patriots who stand for the reunification of the motherland. This united
front will continue to be consolidated and developed. The Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, a broadly based representative organization
of the united front which has played a significant historical role, will play a
still more important role in the country's political and social life, in
promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist
modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country. Multi-party
cooperation and the political consultation system under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China shall continue and develop for the extended future. The
system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the
Communist Party of China will exist and develop in China for a long time to
come.</p>

<p>The People's Republic of China is a unitary multi-national state created
jointly by the people of all its nationalities. Socialist relations of
equality, unity and mutual assistance have been established among the
nationalities and will continue to be strengthened. In the struggle to
safeguard the unity of the nationalities, it is necessary to combat big-nation
chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and to combat local national chauvinism. The
state will do its utmost to promote the common prosperity of all the
nationalities.</p>

<p>China's achievements in revolution and construction are inseparable from the
support of the people of the world. The future of China is closely linked to
the future of the world. China consistently carries out an independent foreign
policy and adheres to the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence in
developing diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with other
countries. China consistently opposes imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism,
works to strengthen unity with people of other countries, supports the
oppressed nations and the developing countries in their just struggle to win
and preserve national independence and develop national economies, and strives
to safeguard world peace and promote the cause of human progress.</p>

<p>This Constitution, in legal form, affirms the achievements of the struggles
of the Chinese people of all nationalities and defines the basic system and
basic tasks of the state; it is the fundamental law of the state and has
supreme legal authority. The people of all nationalities, all state organs, the
armed forces, all political parties and public organizations and all
enterprises and institutions in the country must take the Constitution as the
basic standard of conduct, and they have the duty to uphold the dignity of the
Constitution and ensure its implementation.</p>
