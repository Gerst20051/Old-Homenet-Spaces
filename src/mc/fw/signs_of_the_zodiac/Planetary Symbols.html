  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">MERCURY</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/s.gif" width="19" height="27"><br>
  Mercury represents the part of you that receives and processes all incoming 
  perceptions; your senses themselves; and all the raw, undigested data that 
  pours through them. Mercury represents thinking and speaking; learning; 
  communication; and your brain and nervous system. Your Mercury seeks to label 
  or to find a logical reason for everything, and it tends to look toward the 
  external world for its reasons. Mercury is known as a trickster. Mercury is 
  also associated with transportation and manual dexterity.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">It is as if the very earliest teachings you receive 
  in this life help you to set up an intricate filing system with many labeled 
  folders, into which you organize and store all the raw bits of data that you 
  receive. Anything that does not fit into a file in your filing system is 
  likely to be labeled as &quot;Bad&quot;, or &quot;Wrong &quot; , or &quot;Invalid&quot; (or a similar value 
  judgment label). Because these types of &quot;labels&quot; make the files inaccessible 
  to your &quot;file retrieval system&quot; (conscious processing), your Mercury mind 
  governs the doorway into expanded dimensions of consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">Mercury defines your boundaries with logic and 
  labels. Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, which represent the potential for 
  expanding consciousness, know that what defines you confines you. If your 
  Mercury left brain has only on/off, good/bad kinds of file-folder labels, than 
  you will resist working with the energies of these three &quot;transpersonal&quot; 
  planets, and the friction generated by your resistance is likely to be 
  experienced as some kind of pain. Remember that how you label something is how 
  you will experience it. If you accept Mercury's external reasons as the cause 
  of the discomfort, than you cannot recognize and cooperate with the unfolding 
  inner process. If you have no folders labeled with &quot;process-oriented&quot; labels, 
  you cannot recognize and process transpersonal growth opportunities. Once you 
  recognize the existence of these growth potentials, you can choose to add a 
  few folders to your filing system and open the way for new growth.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you are not in touch with the process, you may 
  fall for Mercury's tricks as he rationalizes, argues, and chatters endlessly.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The sign of your Mercury describes the manner in 
  which you learn, process information, and establish connections with others. 
  The House position describes the area of life situations in which you 
  concentrate on learning and on communicating your perceptions in skills (art, 
  music, etc.) or language.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">VENUS</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/t.gif" width="22" height="25"><br>
  Venus represents the part of you that seeks love, harmony. and appreciation of 
  beauty. It represents your aesthetic values; what you cherish; your taste in 
  colors, shape and sound (what you love); and in relationships (who you love).</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and express your own sense 
  of values, than you may lack serenity and sincerity, and become 
  self-indulgent, overly passive, and overly fond of luxury and comfort.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The Sign and the House position of your Venus 
  describes the process you go through to find the things and the people you 
  love; where your love and appreciation comes from; and the context of what 
  life experiences you find it. Here you seek comfort and harmony.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">MARS</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/u.gif" width="28" height="24"><br>
  Mars represents the process of focusing the power of your will into action. 
  Initiative, Courage, Ambition and Physical energy are all parts of this 
  process. Mars gives you survival energy.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and express your will with 
  courage and decisiveness, than you are likely to feel the fire of Mars as 
  impatience, urgency, rage, or seething resentment. Mars energy demands to be 
  channeled into physical activity and if it is &quot;stuffed&quot; inside with no way to 
  express, it can &quot;draw in life&quot; situations in which you are victimized, 
  experience accidents, or become ill with infections or inflammations. Mars was 
  known to the Ancients as the god of war, and represented violence -- an 
  overabundance of survival energy.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The Sign and House position of you Mars describes the 
  way in which you express courage and initiative, the kind of life situations 
  that excite you, fire you up, and challenge your will, ambition, and courage. 
  Here is where you initiate new experiences and act on personal desire.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">JUPITER</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/v.gif" width="19" height="23"><br>
  Jupiter represents Faith; faith in life itself. It is the process of expanding 
  and overflowing; Joy, Opportunity, Love of freedom, Generosity.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and grasp Jupiter's 
  opportunity, than you may exhibit unrealistic over-confidence, laziness, or 
  scattered energy.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The sign of your Jupiter describes the manner in 
  which you express joy and humor and how you lighten your load. The House 
  position describes the kinds of life situations in which you seek to expand 
  and connect with something bigger than yourself; where you seek faith, trust, 
  and confidence in life.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">SATURN</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/w.gif" width="21" height="25"><br>
  Saturn represents the process of energy slowing down and concentrating into 
  form. Saturn is physical structure, like bones and teeth. It is associated 
  with society's structures, like government, Big Business, and the people 
  associated with them. This process of forming structure demands stern 
  intensity and precise, sober, devoted discipline. Saturn is the potential to 
  distill Wisdom from intense experience.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and express your Saturn 
  energy, then you will seek to avoid the heavy, sobering experiences Saturn's 
  energy attracts. Instead of crystallizing the potential wisdom, you may 
  experience bitterness, doubt, depression, restrictions, despair, delays, 
  inhibitions, or frustrations.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The Sign and the House position of your Saturn 
  describes the kind of devotion and manner of discipline and the area of life 
  situations which demand discipline, structure ( maybe even ruthless 
  dedication) from you. Here you define your place in society by seeking 
  excellence and social approval.</font></p>
  <hr><center>
  <p><b><font size="+2" color="#000080">Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto: <br>
  <font size="+1">Transcending the limits of logic</font></font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p><font color="#000080">Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto represent creative, 
  transpersonal levels of awareness beyond the control and limitations of normal 
  consciousness. You must be open to expanded consciousness to be able to 
  realize the transforming potentials of these Planets. Their affects appear 
  disruptive from the viewpoint of ordinary consciousness. Because your 
  Mercury-mind does not trust anything that transcends the lines of logic that 
  it draws, examine your &quot;Mercury files&quot; in the areas where Uranus, Neptune, and 
  Pluto lie. A critical point here seems to be; give your mercury &quot;some 
  process-oriented &quot; labeled folders so that it will allow you to move beyond 
  normal consciousness.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">All three of these Planets move slowly and stay in a 
  sign for a long time, so their Sign affects a whole generation. Now let us 
  look at each of these individually.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">URANUS</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/x.gif" width="18" height="24"><br>
  Uranus represents the process of breaking free from Saturn-type structures and 
  connecting with universal wholeness; of separating out who you really are from 
  all the &quot;shoulds&quot; laid upon you by the society you live in. Uranus is sudden 
  flashes of insight, mad genius. Uranus interrupts normal reality and 
  challenges you to re-invent yourself.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and respond to your Uranus 
  challenge, you may feel trapped and rebellious, experiencing anxiety, nervous 
  tension, or unpleasant surprises like accidents.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The Sign of your Uranus describes the manner in which 
  you strive to be uniquely yourself. The House position describes the kind of 
  life situations that demand individuation and innovative genius to free your 
  soul, and where your &quot;rule-breaking&quot; behavior tends to annoy those in 
  authority.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">NEPTUNE</font></b></i>&nbsp;<img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/y.gif" width="20" height="24"><br>
  Neptune is the process of dissolving beyond boundaries. It is the doorway into 
  the &quot;not-self&quot;, the Planet of trance, meditation, dreams. Neptune is the 
  creative Muse of the artist, writer, and musician.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and move into Neptune's 
  illumination, you may become deceived by illusion. Glamour enchants you into 
  self-deception and self-destructive patterns of escape, distorting your fears 
  and your wishes. Addictions to drugs or alcohol are an example of a Neptune's 
  glamorous, destructive, escape patterns.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The Sign of your Neptune describes the process you 
  must go though in order to move through the boundaries of this world and of 
  yourself. The House position describes where you seek transcendence in 
  solitude, and the area of life experience where disillusionment is a spiritual 
  catalyst.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000080"><i><b><font size="+1">PLUTO</font></b></i> &nbsp;
  <img src="../../../i/mc/fw/zodiac/z.gif" width="18" height="24"><br>
  Pluto represents the process of death and regeneration. Pluto rules the 
  underworld, frightening and impolite issues that you will be tempted to avoid; 
  death, disease, personal shame, sexuality. Pluto demands that you face your 
  own wounds, squarely and honestly. If you meet its demands, it offers you a 
  way to create an unshakable sense of meaning in your life.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">If you fail to recognize and cooperate with the 
  process, you may experience intense fears, paranoia, stagnation, and despair.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000080">The sign of your Pluto describes the kind of energy 
  needed to process your deep, dark, shadow side; the kind of energy that you 
  have the potential to use for powerful healing and rebirth. The house position 
  describes where your personal &quot;garbage&quot; is buried; where your deepest, darkest 
  fears are; and the kind of life experiences that will challenge you to face 
  them, heal them, and find your deepest meaning in life. Pluto pushes you to 
  look deeply within the darkest part of you self; to dig in the dirt and mire 
  or your own inner &quot;garbage&quot; and find the treasure buried there.</font></p>
