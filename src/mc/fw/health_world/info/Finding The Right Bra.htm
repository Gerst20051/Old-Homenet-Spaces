      <td width="100%">Why bother with bras?<p>Bras not only minimize jiggling and 
      shape the appearance of a girl&#39;s breasts, they&#39;re also helpful from a health 
      standpoint. Wearing the right bra keeps a girl&#39;s breasts supported while she&#39;s 
      playing a sport and can help prevent injury to breast tissue. A well-fitting 
      bra is also important for a woman&#39;s posture, particularly if she has large 
      breasts. A bra that doesn&#39;t fit can cause back problems, muscle tension, and 
      even headaches.</p>
      <p>Yet 8 out of 10 women wear bras that don&#39;t fit.</p>
      <h3>All About Straps, Snaps, Bands, and Cups</h3>
      <p>Finding the right bra doesn&#39;t have to be an ordeal if you know the basics 
      of bra sizing. There are two parts to a bra&#39;s size: the chest size (also called 
      the band size) and the cup size.</p>
      <p>The chest, or band, size is the part of the bra that runs across a girl&#39;s 
      chest and around her back. The cups are the parts of the bra that hold the 
      breasts. Bras come in many sizes, which are different combinations of the 
      chest sizes (shown as numbers — in the United States, these are 32, 34, 36, 
      etc.) and cup sizes (shown as letters — AA, A, B, C, etc.)</p>
      <p>It&#39;s important to get both the chest and cup sizes right to ensure a proper 
      fit. Some bra manufacturers are now starting to offer cup options in half 
      sizes in addition to regular cups to help girls get a better fit.</p>
      <p>If a girl wears a bra that&#39;s the wrong chest size, the bra&#39;s band will 
      either feel tight and uncomfortable around her rib cage or it will be too 
      loose and ride up her breasts. Bras that are too small in the cup will compress 
      a girl&#39;s boobs and force them to bulge out the sides (think armpit boobs). 
      And cups that are too big can wrinkle and pucker, which won&#39;t look good under 
      clothes.</p>
      <p>So how do you calculate your chest and cup measurements? It&#39;s easy, and 
      it&#39;s something you can do in the privacy of your own room at home. All that 
      you need is a tape measure.</p>

      <img class="right" src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/Finding%20The%20Right%20Bra/1.gif" align="right" border="0" width="167" height="92"></a><strong>Chest 
      measurement.</strong> Bra fitting experts offer two methods of calculating 
      the chest measurement. The most common method involves running a tape measure 
      just <em>under</em> your breasts, all the way around your back and rib cage. 
      The tape measure should rest flat on your skin and lie straight across your 
      back — not so tight that it digs in, but not so loose that it sags down in 
      back. Make a note of your measurement and add 5 inches. That&#39;s your chest 
      size.</p>
      <p>You can also estimate your chest size by running a tape measure across 
      your chest <em>above</em> your breasts, under your armpits, and around your 
      back (measure from the same back position as in the first chest measurement 
      option). This method is easier because you don&#39;t have to do any addition or 
      other calculation, but some people feel it&#39;s less accurate than using the 
      first method.</p>
      <p>If your chest measurement comes out as an odd number (such as 31 inches 
      or 33 inches), it&#39;s usually a good rule to round up to the next number. Most 
      bras have a few sets of adjustable hooks and eyes, so you can adjust the tightness. 
      It&#39;s a good idea to round <em>up</em>, rather than round down, because when 
      you buy a new bra that hooks on the first or middle hooks — rather than on 
      the last — you can leave room for growth.</p>
      <p><strong>Cup measurement.</strong> As with the chest measurement, when you&#39;re 
      measuring for cup size, make sure the tape is not too loose or too tight. 
      If you already own an <em>unpadded</em> bra that fits well, wear it when measuring 
      for cup size. Be careful about the type of bra you wear to take your measurements, 
      though. Sports bras can flatten breasts and give a cup reading that&#39;s too 
      small, and padded or lined bras have the opposite effect.</p>
      <p>This time, when you run the tape measure around your body, you&#39;re going 
      to take the measurement across the <em>fullest</em> part of your breasts. 
      Write down this number. Now subtract your chest measurement. If the difference 
      between the two numbers is less than 1 inch, your cup size is AA. If it&#39;s 
      1 inch, your cup size is A; 2 inches, you&#39;re a B; 3 inches you&#39;re a C, and 
      so on.</p>
      <p>So you&#39;ve taken your measurements and you&#39;re in the fitting room trying 
      a bra in what&#39;s supposed to be your size — but it doesn&#39;t seem to fit. Now 
      what?</p>
      <p>Before you pile on all your clothes just to go out and look for a different 
      size, experiment by making some adjustments to the bra. Extend or shorten 
      the band around your chest slightly by moving the hooks to a different eye 
      on the hook and eye closure (or adjust the velcro if the bra has a velcro 
      closing). The bottom band of a properly fitting bra should ride across the 
      middle of your back and pass under your shoulder blades to provide the right 
      support.</p>
      <p>A bra&#39;s straps allow you to modify how the cups fit and support your breasts. 
      When the straps are the right length, a bra lifts the breasts comfortably 
      and the back of the bra will run straight across your back (if a bra is pulling 
      upward in the back, it may be a sign that the straps are too tight). You should 
      be able to get one finger under the straps to prevent them from digging into 
      your shoulders. In general, girls who are petite will need to wear their bra 
      straps shorter than girls who are tall.</p>
      <h3>Bra Booby Traps</h3>
      <p>In addition to fit, there are some other things you might want to take 
      into account when choosing a bra.</p>
      <p><strong>Breast growth.</strong> A girl&#39;s breasts can grow and change rapidly 
      during the teen years, which means that until you stop developing, you might 
      have to change your bra size several times. If your breasts are still growing, 
      consider buying fewer bras and measure yourself frequently to double-check 
      your size.</p>
      <p>Because growth can make a girl&#39;s breasts sensitive, you might find certain 
      styles or fabrics work better for you. For example, some girls like seamless 
      cups because they don&#39;t irritate the nipples; others choose styles that minimize 
      jiggle to ease the occasional aches of breast development.</p>
      <p><strong>Menstrual changes.</strong> Some girls&#39; breasts change size or 
      shape at different times in their menstrual cycles. Many girls find they like 
      to wear different styles of bras at different times in their cycle.</p>
      <p><strong>Different-sized breasts.</strong> Most girls&#39; breasts grow at different 
      rates — and many girls find themselves with one boob that&#39;s bigger than its 
      partner. This is so common that bra manufacturers design their products so 
      they can be adjusted to accommodate asymmetrical breasts. Start by moving 
      the strap adjusters on a bra to different lengths to see if this helps.</p>
      <p>Some girls also use the trick of buying a bra that has removable padding 
      and then taking the extra padding out of the cup for the larger breast. Push-up 
      bras can work well for this because they often come with an easily removable 
      padded section (called a &quot;cookie&quot;) that sits under the breast.</p>
      <p><strong>Hooks, wires, and other hazards.</strong> Take a look at the bra 
      you&#39;re about to buy and imagine how it might survive a full day of wear. If 
      the front closure pops open too easily, could this bra let you down in front 
      of your entire drama class? The bra&#39;s straps may feel fine in the fitting 
      room, but if the adjusters are sitting right on your shoulder or collarbone, 
      how will that feel under your backpack?</p>
      <p>Test to see if the bra band is too loose by lifting your arms in the air 
      and putting them back down by your sides a couple of times. If the bra rides 
      up across your breasts, the band is too loose. If you&#39;re looking for a sports 
      bra, jump up and down in the fitting room a couple of times to evaluate the 
      bra&#39;s bounce control.</p>
      <p>You may also want to try on a T-shirt or sweater over a bra you&#39;re thinking 
      of buying to get the finished effect. That pink rose on the front may look 
      cute on the bra itself, but does it make you look as if you&#39;ve sprouted a 
      third breast once your T-shirt&#39;s on?</p>
      <p>No matter what the size or shape of a girl&#39;s breasts, the most important 
      thing to remember in choosing a bra is comfort. Try on a variety of bras to 
      find the one that&#39;s right for you. Some girls prefer the comfort of cotton, 
      others like the support of synthetics or underwires. There are minimizer bras 
      for girls who&#39;d like their breasts to look smaller, or padded bras for girls 
      who&#39;d like a little extra shape. No one bra is better than another — it all 
      depends on which style works best for you.</p>
