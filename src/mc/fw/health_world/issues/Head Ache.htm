There are four types of headache:&nbsp; vascular, muscle contraction (tension), 
traction, and inflammatory.&nbsp; The most common type of vascular headache is migraine. 
Migraine headaches are usually characterized by severe pain on one or both sides 
of the head, an upset stomach, and, at times, disturbed vision.&nbsp;&nbsp; Women 
are more likely than men to have migraine headaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After migraine, 
the most common type of vascular headache is the toxic headache produced by fever.&nbsp; 
Other kinds of vascular headaches include &quot;cluster” headaches, which cause repeated 
episodes of intense pain, and headaches resulting from high blood pressure.&nbsp; 
Muscle contraction headaches appear to involve the tightening or tensing of facial 
and neck muscles.&nbsp; Traction and inflammatory headaches are symptoms of other 
disorders, ranging from stroke to sinus infection.&nbsp; Like other types of pain, 
headaches can serve as warning signals of more serious disorders. This is particularly 
true for headaches caused by inflammation, including those related to meningitis 
as well as those resulting from diseases of the sinuses, spine, neck, ears, and 
teeth. </p>

  When headaches occur three or more times a month, preventive treatment is usually 
  recommended.&nbsp; Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination 
  of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling 
  migraine and other vascular headaches. Regular exercise, such as swimming or vigorous 
  walking, can also reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches.&nbsp; 
  Drug therapy for migraine is often combined with biofeedback and relaxation training.&nbsp; 
  One of the most commonly used drugs for the relief of migraine symptoms is sumatriptan.&nbsp; 
  Drugs used to prevent migraine also include methysergide maleate, which counteracts 
  blood vessel constriction; propranolol hydrochloride, which also reduces the frequency 
  and severity of migraine headaches; ergotamine tartrate, a vasoconstrictor that 
  helps counteract the painful dilation stage of the headache; amitriptyline, an 
  antidepressant; valproic acid, an anticonvulsant; and verapamil, a calcium channel 
  blocker.

  Not all headaches require medical attention. But some types of headache are signals 
  of more serious disorders and call for prompt medical care. These include: sudden, 
  severe headache or sudden headache associated with a stiff neck; headaches associated 
  with fever, convulsions, or accompanied by confusion or loss of consciousness; 
  headaches following a blow to the head, or associated with pain in the eye or 
  ear; persistent headache in a person who was previously headache free; and recurring 
  headache in children.&nbsp; Migraine headaches may last a day or more and can 
  strike as often as several times a week or as rarely as once every few years.</div>

  <p class="MsoNormal">The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 
  (NINDS) conducts research <a id="OLE_LINK1" name="OLE_LINK1">relating to</a> headaches 
  at its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and supports additional 
  research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.&nbsp; 
  NINDS also supports and conducts studies to improve the diagnosis of headaches 
  and to find ways to prevent them.</p>
