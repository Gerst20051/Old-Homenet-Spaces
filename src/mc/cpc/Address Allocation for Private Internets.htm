<p>Status of this Memo<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; improvements.&nbsp; Distribution of this memo is unlimited.<br>
<br>
1. Introduction<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of this document, an enterprise is an entity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; autonomously operating a network using TCP/IP and in particular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; determining the addressing plan and address assignments within that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This document describes address allocation for private internets. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; allocation permits full network layer connectivity among all hosts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; inside an enterprise as well as among all public hosts of different<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprises. The cost of using private internet address space is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; potentially costly effort to renumber hosts and networks between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public and private.<br>
<br>
2. Motivation<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the proliferation of TCP/IP technology worldwide, including<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; outside the Internet itself, an increasing number of non-connected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprises use this technology and its addressing capabilities for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sole intra-enterprise communications, without any intention to ever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; directly connect to other enterprises or the Internet itself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet has grown beyond anyone&#39;s expectations. Sustained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; exponential growth continues to introduce new challenges.&nbsp; One<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; challenge is a concern within the community that globally unique<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; address space will be exhausted. A separate and far more pressing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; concern is that the amount of routing overhead will grow beyond the<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; capabilities of Internet Service Providers. Efforts are in progress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; within the community to find long term solutions to both of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; problems. Meanwhile it is necessary to revisit address allocation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; procedures, and their impact on the Internet routing system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To contain growth of routing overhead, an Internet Provider obtains 
a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; block of address space from an address registry, and then assigns to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; its customers addresses from within that block based on each customer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; requirement. The result of this process is that routes to many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; customers will be aggregated together, and will appear to other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; providers as a single route [<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1518.html">RFC1518</a>], 
[<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1519.html">RFC1519</a>].&nbsp; In order for 
route<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; aggregation to be effective, Internet providers encourage customers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; joining their network to use the provider&#39;s block, and thus renumber<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; their computers. Such encouragement may become a requirement in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; future.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the current size of the Internet and its growth rate it is no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; longer realistic to assume that by virtue of acquiring globally<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; unique IP addresses out of an Internet registry an organization that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; acquires such addresses would have Internet-wide IP connectivity once<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the organization gets connected to the Internet. To the contrary, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is quite likely that when the organization would connect to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet to achieve Internet-wide IP connectivity the organization<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; would need to change IP addresses (renumber) all of its public hosts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (hosts that require Internet-wide IP connectivity), regardless of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; whether the addresses used by the organization initially were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; globally unique or not.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been typical to assign globally unique addresses to all hosts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that use TCP/IP. In order to extend the life of the IPv4 address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; space, address registries are requiring more justification than ever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; before, making it harder for organizations to acquire additional<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; address space [<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1466.html">RFC1466</a>].<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hosts within enterprises that use IP can be partitioned into three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; categories:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category 1: hosts that do not require access to hosts 
in other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
enterprises or the Internet at large; hosts within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
this category may use IP addresses that are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
unambiguous within an enterprise, but may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
ambiguous between enterprises.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category 2: hosts that need access to a limited set 
of outside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
services (e.g., E-mail, FTP, netnews, remote login)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
which can be handled by mediating gateways (e.g.,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
application layer gateways). For many hosts in this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
category an unrestricted external access (provided<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
via IP connectivity) may be unnecessary and even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
undesirable for privacy/security reasons. Just like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
hosts within the first category, such hosts may use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
IP addresses that are unambiguous within an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
enterprise, but may be ambiguous between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
enterprises.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category 3: hosts that need network layer access 
outside the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
enterprise (provided via IP connectivity); hosts in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
the last category require IP addresses that are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
globally unambiguous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We will refer to the hosts in the first and second categories as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;private&quot;.&nbsp; We will refer to the hosts in the third category as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;public&quot;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Many applications require connectivity only within one enterprise and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; do not need external (outside the enterprise) connectivity for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; majority of internal hosts. In larger enterprises it is often easy 
to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; identify a substantial number of hosts using TCP/IP that do not need<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; network layer connectivity outside the enterprise.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples, where external connectivity might not be required,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A large airport which has its 
arrival/departure displays<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individually addressable 
via TCP/IP. It is very unlikely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that these displays 
need to be directly accessible from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other networks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Large organizations like banks 
and retail chains are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switching to TCP/IP 
for their internal communication. Large<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; numbers of local workstations 
like cash registers, money<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machines, and equipment 
at clerical positions rarely need<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to have such connectivity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - For security reasons, many enterprises 
use application<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; layer gateways to connect 
their internal network to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet.&nbsp; The 
internal network usually does not have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direct access to the 
Internet, thus only one or more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gateways are visible 
from the Internet. In this case, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal network can 
use non-unique IP network numbers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Interfaces of routers on an internal 
network usually do not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to be directly 
accessible from outside the enterprise.<br>
<br>
3. Private Address Space<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.0.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 
10.255.255.255&nbsp; (10/8 prefix)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 172.16.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 
172.31.255.255&nbsp; (172.16/12 prefix)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.0.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.255.255 
(192.168/16 prefix)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We will refer to the first block as &quot;24-bit block&quot;, the second as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;20-bit block&quot;, and to the third as &quot;16-bit&quot; block. Note that (in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; pre-CIDR notation) the first block is nothing but a single class A<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; network number, while the second block is a set of 16 contiguous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; class B network numbers, and third block is a set of 256 contiguous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; class C network numbers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; An enterprise that decides to use IP addresses out of the address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; space defined in this document can do so without any coordination<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; with IANA or an Internet registry. The address space can thus be used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; by many enterprises. Addresses within this private address space will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; only be unique within the enterprise, or the set of enterprises which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; choose to cooperate over this space so they may communicate with each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; other in their own private internet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, any enterprise that needs globally unique address space 
is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required to obtain such addresses from an Internet registry. An<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprise that requests IP addresses for its external connectivity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will never be assigned addresses from the blocks defined above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to use private address space, an enterprise needs to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; determine which hosts do not need to have network layer connectivity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; outside the enterprise in the foreseeable future and thus could be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; classified as private. Such hosts will use the private address space<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; defined above.&nbsp; Private hosts can communicate with all other hosts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; inside the enterprise, both public and private. However, they cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; have IP connectivity to any host outside of the enterprise. While not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; having external (outside of the enterprise) IP connectivity private<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; hosts can still have access to external services via mediating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gateways (e.g., application layer gateways).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All other hosts will be public and will use globally unique address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; space assigned by an Internet Registry. Public hosts can communicate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; with other hosts inside the enterprise both public and private and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; can have IP connectivity to public hosts outside the enterprise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Public hosts do not have connectivity to private hosts of other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprises.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving a host from private to public or vice versa involves a change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of IP address, changes to the appropriate DNS entries, and changes 
to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configuration files on other hosts that reference the host by IP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; address.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because private addresses have no global meaning, routing information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; about private networks shall not be propagated on inter-enterprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; links, and packets with private source or destination addresses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; should not be forwarded across such links. Routers in networks not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; using private address space, especially those of Internet service<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; providers, are expected to be configured to reject (filter out)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; routing information about private networks. If such a router receives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; such information the rejection shall not be treated as a routing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; protocol error.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Indirect references to such addresses should be contained within the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprise. Prominent examples of such references are DNS Resource<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Records and other information referring to internal private<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; addresses. In particular, Internet service providers should take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; measures to prevent such leakage.<br>
<br>
4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Private Address Space<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The obvious advantage of using private address space for the Internet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; at large is to conserve the globally unique address space by not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; using it where global uniqueness is not required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enterprises themselves also enjoy a number of benefits from their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; usage of private address space: They gain a lot of flexibility in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; network design by having more address space at their disposal than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; they could obtain from the globally unique pool. This enables<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; operationally and administratively convenient addressing schemes as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; well as easier growth paths.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a variety of reasons the Internet has already encountered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; situations where an enterprise that has not been connected to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet had used IP address space for its hosts without getting this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; space assigned from the IANA. In some cases this address space had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; been already assigned to other enterprises. If such an enterprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; would later connects to the Internet, this could potentially create<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; very serious problems, as IP routing cannot provide correct<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; operations in presence of ambiguous addressing. Although in principle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet Service Providers should guard against such mistakes through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the use of route filters, this does not always happen in practice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using private address space provides a safe choice for such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprises, avoiding clashes once outside connectivity is needed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A major drawback to the use of private address space is that it may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; actually reduce an enterprise&#39;s flexibility to access the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once one commits to using a private address, one is committing to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; renumber part or all of an enterprise, should one decide to provide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; IP connectivity between that part (or all of the enterprise) and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet.&nbsp; Usually the cost of renumbering can be measured by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; counting the number of hosts that have to transition from private to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public. As was discussed earlier, however, even if a network uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; globally unique addresses, it may still have to renumber in order to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; acquire Internet-wide IP connectivity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another drawback to the use of private address space is that it may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; require renumbering when merging several private internets into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; single private internet. If we review the examples we list in Section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2, we note that companies tend to merge. If such companies prior to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the merge maintained their uncoordinated internets using private<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; address space, then if after the merge these private internets would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be combined into a single private internet, some addresses within the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; combined private internet may not be unique. As a result, hosts with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these addresses would need to be renumbered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cost of renumbering may well be mitigated by development and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; deployment of tools that facilitate renumbering (e.g.&nbsp; Dynamic 
Host<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Configuration Protocol (DHCP)). When deciding whether to use private<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; addresses, we recommend to inquire computer and software vendors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; about availability of such tools.&nbsp; A separate IETF effort (PIER<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Working Group) is pursuing full documentation of the requirements and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; procedures for renumbering.<br>
<br>
5. Operational Considerations<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One possible strategy is to design the private part of the network<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; first and use private address space for all internal links. Then plan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public subnets at the locations needed and design the external<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; connectivity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This design does not need to be fixed permanently. If a group of one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; or more hosts requires to change their status (from private to public<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; or vice versa) later, this can be accomplished by renumbering only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the hosts involved, and changing physical connectivity, if needed. 
In<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; locations where such changes can be foreseen (machine rooms, etc.),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; it is advisable to configure separate physical media for public and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private subnets to facilitate such changes.&nbsp; In order to avoid 
major<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; network disruptions, it is advisable to group hosts with similar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; connectivity needs on their own subnets.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If a suitable subnetting scheme can be designed and is supported by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the equipment concerned, it is advisable to use the 24-bit block<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (class A network) of private address space and make an addressing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; plan with a good growth path. If subnetting is a problem, the 16-bit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; block (class C networks), or the 20-bit block (class B networks) of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private address space can be used.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; One might be tempted to have both public and private addresses on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; same physical medium. While this is possible, there are pitfalls to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; such a design (note that the pitfalls have nothing to do with the use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of private addresses, but are due to the presence of multiple IP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; subnets on a common Data Link subnetwork).&nbsp; We advise caution 
when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; proceeding in this area.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is strongly recommended that routers which connect enterprises to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; external networks are set up with appropriate packet and routing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; filters at both ends of the link in order to prevent packet and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; routing information leakage. An enterprise should also filter any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private networks from inbound routing information in order to protect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; itself from ambiguous routing situations which can occur if routes 
to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the private address space point outside the enterprise.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible for two sites, who both coordinate their private<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; address space, to communicate with each other over a public network.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To do so they must use some method of encapsulation at their borders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to a public network, thus keeping their private addresses private.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If two (or more) organizations follow the address allocation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; specified in this document and then later wish to establish IP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; connectivity with each other, then there is a risk that address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; uniqueness would be violated.&nbsp; To minimize the risk it is strongly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; recommended that an organization using private IP addresses choose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; randomly from the reserved pool of private addresses, when allocating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sub-blocks for its internal allocation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If an enterprise uses the private address space, or a mix of private<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and public address spaces, then DNS clients outside of the enterprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; should not see addresses in the private address space used by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enterprise, since these addresses would be ambiguous.&nbsp; One way 
to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure this is to run two authority servers for each DNS zone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; containing both publically and privately addressed hosts.&nbsp; One 
server<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; would be visible from the public address space and would contain only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the subset of the enterprise&#39;s addresses which were reachable using<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public addresses.&nbsp; The other server would be reachable only from 
the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private network and would contain the full set of data, including the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private addresses and whatever public addresses are reachable the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private network.&nbsp; In order to ensure consistency, both servers 
should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be configured from the same data of which the publically visible zone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; only contains a filtered version. There is certain degree of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; additional complexity associated with providing these capabilities.<br>
<br>
6. Security Considerations<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Security issues are not addressed in this memo.<br>
<br>
7. Conclusion<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the described scheme many large enterprises will need only a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; relatively small block of addresses from the globally unique IP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; address space. The Internet at large benefits through conservation 
of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; globally unique address space which will effectively lengthen the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; lifetime of the IP address space. The enterprises benefit from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; increased flexibility provided by a relatively large private address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; space. However, use of private addressing requires that an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; organization renumber part or all of its enterprise network, as its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; connectivity requirements change over time.<br>
