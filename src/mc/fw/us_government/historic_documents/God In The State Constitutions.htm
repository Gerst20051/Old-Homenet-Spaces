<p>The subject of God in the Constitution arises from time to time, and this
site <a href="constnot.html#god">deals with the topic specifically</a>
elsewhere. However, another question also arises: how is God referenced, if at
all, in <em>state</em> constitutions.</p>

<p>This list is not guaranteed to be exhaustive, but it attempts to be. Using
the most recent version of each state's constitution, these words were searched
for: God, Lord, Creator, Christ. Other variations were recorded when noted.
Each instance is noted below, alphabetically by state name. Copied portions are
excerpts only - only the sentence with the term in question is included. Refer
to the original document for context.</p>

<p>Content notes: When the usage of the word "Lord" is in the context of a
date, only the usage and the accompanying date is noted below. When the words
"so help me God" are in an oath of office, only the words "so help me God" are
noted below. Also see <a href="#summ">summary notes</a>.</p>

<hr class=thicker title="Notes follow">

<p><a name="summ"><b>Notes</b></a></p>

<p>The above excerpts illustrate some interesting points:

<ul>

 <li>In almost all cases, states mention God in the preambles to their
 Constitutions. Only a few do not. New Hampshire, Vermont, and Virginia do not
 have preambles. Tennessee's only mentions "Lord" in the context of dates.
 Oregon's preamble is decidedly neutral.</li>

 <li>The use of the term "in the year of our Lord" is very common.</li>

 <li>Many states mention God in sections that refer to religious freedom,
 but many of those refer to "Almighty God," which, by all objective standards,
 is an endorsement of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic deity (several of the
 religious freedom sections mention Christianity specifically).</li>

 <li>A handful of states, Arkansas, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee,
 have provisions that deny elective office to anyone who does not believe in
 God. These provisions are probably not enforceable. In Arkansas and Maryland,
 persons who do not believe in God are constitutionally forbidden from being
 witnesses in a trial.</li>

 <li>The oaths of office codified in the various constitutions often include
 the closing statement, "So help me God." Several states allow an alternate
 statement such as "Under the pains and penalties of perjury." Several do not
 allow an alternate closing, and several have no such closing whatever.</li>
