<p><b>What is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?</b><br id="XSpLit109">

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful progressive condition caused by compression 
of a key nerve in the wrist.&nbsp;&nbsp; It occurs when the median nerve, which runs from 
the forearm into the hand, becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist.&nbsp; Symptoms 
usually start gradually, with&nbsp; pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and 
wrist, radiating up the arm.&nbsp; As symptoms worsen, people might feel tingling 
during the day, and decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a 
fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks.&nbsp; In some cases no 
direct cause of the syndrome can be identified.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most likely the disorder is 
due to a congenital predisposition - the carpal tunnel is simply smaller in some 
people than in others.&nbsp; However, the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome 
is especially common in those performing assembly line work.</p>
<p><b>Is there any treatment?</b><br>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Initial treatment generally 
  involves resting the affected hand and wrist for at least 2 weeks, avoiding 
  activities that may worsen symptoms, and immobilizing the wrist in a splint to 
  avoid further damage from twisting or bending.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonsteroidal 
  anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonprescription 
  pain relievers, may ease pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cool (ice) packs and prednisone (taken by 
  mouth) or lidocaine (injected directly into the wrist) can relieve swelling 
  and pressure on the median nerve and provide immediate, temporary relief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Recurrence of carpal tunnel 
  syndrome following treatment is rare. The majority of patients recover 
  completely.&nbsp; To prevent workplace-related carpal tunnel syndrome, workers can 
  do on-the-job conditioning, perform stretching exercises, take frequent rest 
  breaks, wear splints to keep wrists straight, and use correct posture and 
  wrist position. Wearing fingerless gloves can help keep hands warm and 
  flexible.

<p><b>What research is being done?</b><br>

<div class="rxbodyfield" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office">
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The National Institute of 
  Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research on nerve-related 
  conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome in its laboratories at the National 
  Institutes of Health (NIH) and also supports research through grants to major 
  medical institutions across the country.&nbsp; Current studies include several 
  randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of educational 
  interventions in reducing the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome. Another 
  clinical study is collecting data about carpal tunnel syndrome among 
  construction apprentices to better understand specific work factors associated 
  with the disorder and develop strategies to prevent its occurrence among 
  construction and other workers.&nbsp; Scientists are also investigating the use of 
  alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, to prevent and treat this 
  disorder.</div>
