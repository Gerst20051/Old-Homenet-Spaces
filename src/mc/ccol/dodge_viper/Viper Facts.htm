    Information:</strong> <br>
    The 2006 Dodge Viper is a 2-door, 2-passenger sports car, or convertible sports 
    car, available in two trims, the SRT-10 Convertible and the SRT-10 Coupe. Upon 
    introduction, both trims are equipped with a standard 8.3-liter, V10, 510-horsepower 
    engine that achieves 12-mpg in the city and 20-mpg on the highway. A 6-speed 
    manual transmission with overdrive is standard. The 2006 SRT-10 Convertible 
    is a carryover from 2005. The SRT-10 Coupe has been redesigned for 2006. <br>

    Growing up, we’re taught to greet our elders with it, pretend to have it for 
    our teachers, and show an undeserving amount of it to our siblings.</span> Failure 
    to do any of the above quickly labels you a bad seed looking for trouble.</p>
    <p>It’s respect, the whole R-E-S-P-E-C-T thing Aretha Franklin sang about, and 
    it pervades every aspect of human existence. Not only must we demonstrate deference 
    to society’s wizened senior citizens, but also to authority figures who are 
    charged with public safety and to eager, young and impressionable eyes looking 
    for a role model. Even animals deserve and, frankly, demand this intangible 
    entity, as horrifically proven in the recent film, <i>Grizzly Man</i>, where 
    a brief lack of the utmost respect resulted in a gruesome death.</p>
    <p>Consider the same to be true with cars, which nowadays offer more horsepower 
    and torque than ever, handling that suggests corners can be taken at imprudent 
    speeds, and so many safety systems that watching TV on the couch looks comparatively 
    dangerous. A prime example is the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe, a hardtop, 
    3,410-lb. two-seater that pushes 510 horses and 535 lb.-ft. of twist from an 
    angry V10 engine to the massive rear wheels. This is a ride that requires effort 
    to <i>not</i> spin the tires, and much concentration to keep ‘er under 100 mph. 
    But without any standard or optional traction or stability control systems, 
    if you get a little too comfortable behind the wheel, a little too tight with 
    that eager accelerator or twitchy with that exacting steering wheel, this snake 
    will quickly whip around and sink its fangs in deep. Yet, treat this high-octane 
    beast correctly, much like you would its namesake, and be rewarded with raw 
    power and an unflinching desire to annihilate all speed limits, straighten all 
    curves, and swallow lesser vehicles whole. With the right driver and the right 
    road, the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 is as close to a street-legal racer as you 
    may find, and it is the wise one who will treat it as such. Just don’t expect 
    it to respect you back.</p>
    <p>Buying into a relationship with the Viper Coupe requires putting $86,995 
    in the hands of your local Dodge dealer, $3,000 of which covers a gas guzzler 
    tax and $850 for destination charges. With that significant outlay of greenbacks 
    comes an 8.3-liter V10 engine pushing 510 horsepower and 535 lb.-ft. of torque 
    mated to a six-speed manual transmission and a limited slip rear differential, 
    Brembo vented antilock disc brakes, a power rack-and-pinion steering system, 
    and a fully-independent suspension with upper and lower A-arms front and rear. 
    Stuffed into the wheel wells are five-spoke alloys wearing Michelin Pilot Sport 
    run-flat tires measuring 275/35R18 in front and 345/30R19 out back.</p>
    <p>Interior accoutrements featured with the base price include the typical power 
    items, power foot pedals, a 310-watt sound system with a six-disc CD changer, 
    leather seats, dual front airbags, and a tire pressure monitor. Sirius satellite 
    radio is a $195 option. Venture to the exterior for a view of the integrated 
    front fog lights; high-intensity discharge headlights; two different wheel options 
    that retail for $700; black or silver stripes that add $3,000 to the final tally; 
    or one of three $600 paint colors – Copperhead Orange, Viper GTS Blue, and Viper 
    Race Yellow. Available at no cost are Viper Black and Viper Red.</p>
    <p>Our test car was a Viper Red 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe with the $3,000 
    silver stripe package, bringing the total bill to $89,995. As expected, our 
    editors took advantage of every opportunity to “evaluate” the Viper over the 
    course of a week, covering highways, city streets, and challenging back roads 
    all over Southern California.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Christian Wardlaw’s 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe Driving Impressions:</b><br>
    Driving the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe on public roads does not do the car 
    justice. Even ripping down my favorite road in the Santa Monica Mountains as 
    fast as conditions allowed, I could only glimpse what the Viper would be capable 
    of in its element: the race track. This is a car clearly set up for hard charging 
    around a closed course with plenty of run-off on either side of the blacktop. 
    The sheer rock cliffs, tight shoulders, lumpy pavement, oncoming traffic, steep 
    drop-offs, and occasional hiker or bicyclist that characterize the mountain 
    road on which I drive almost every test vehicle make it no place to test a Viper’s 
    considerable limits. Add to this mix the chilly temperatures, damp shadowed 
    patches of blacktop, and recent rockslides this stretch of road revealed on 
    the winter morning I had the keys to the Viper, and, well, it comes as no surprise 
    that the car remains almost as much a mystery as it was when I first got in 
    to make a mid-day run down the 405 freeway to Best Buy.</p>
    <p>This much I can tell you. The 2006 Dodge Viper is ridiculously fast, tugs 
    at every ripple and groove in the road surface, and sends every single crack, 
    joint, and bump on the pavement directly to the cabin. I haven’t driven a road 
    car this raw since the Ford Mustang Cobra R, or the first-gen Viper GTS Coupe. 
    Launch the car, punch the accelerator, and you can’t help but spin the massive 
    rear wheels. Shifts come hard and quick, the clutch easier to operate than the 
    previous Viper – or a recent Honda Accord V6 we had in the test pool. On public 
    roads, you’re constantly aware of the Viper’s width, an issue that would disappear 
    on the track. The steering and brakes respond instantly, the suspension erasing 
    all unnecessary motion. Tire grip is extraordinary, as long as you keep your 
    foot out of the throttle.</p>
    <p>Indeed, the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe is a thrill to drive, an adrenaline 
    injection like few others. But aside from attracting attention to yourself, 
    making lots of noise, and compensating for, ahem, shortcomings, I see little 
    point to owning a Viper if you’re not going to take it to the track.</p>
    <p><b>Thom Blackett’s 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe Driving Impressions: </b>
    <br>
    Good God, man. </p>
    <p>Push the start button and you know you’re in for an experience unlike most 
    others, even if you’re ignorant to the fact that 510 horses and 535 lb.-ft. 
    of torque are impatiently lying behind that aluminum gas pedal. Our tester had 
    a clutch that was a little late in engaging, but once it hooked up it didn’t 
    take long to get a sense of the Viper’s power. On my first bit of driving, on 
    a straight and isolated stretch of road, while already moving along at about 
    20 mph, I goosed the throttle in first gear and the 19-inch rear rubber instantly 
    started spinning and the rear started to dance a little from side to side. Ah, 
    right, no traction or stability control on this baby. </p>
    <p>Further along the drive route, the Viper’s power made its presence known 
    in other ways. While using a straightaway to row through the six-speed a bit, 
    I noticed that the tachometer was only registering about 2,000 rpms at near 
    triple-digit speeds in fourth gear, and that was just skimming the surface of 
    the V10’s potential. Fifth and sixth gears are only necessary on the highways, 
    and even then they keep the rpm’s ridiculously low at a pace more than slightly 
    above the posted limit. </p>
    <p>On curvy back roads, the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe offers razor-sharp 
    steering with tremendous feel through the wheel, and brakes that would probably 
    be sufficient for stopping a semi-truck weighing several tons. And while there’s 
    no noticeable understeer or oversteer, all of that power going to the rear wheels 
    makes for a tail that likes to flick out unprovoked. Combine a touch too much 
    steering with a hair too much pressure on the throttle and you’ll instantly 
    be testing your recovery skills. </p>
    <p><b>Brian Chee’s 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe Driving Impressions:</b><br>
    It is alive. And it is angry, always angry, and is always looking to eat. The 
    monster that lives inside the 2006 Dodge Viper is not to be trifled with, not 
    with polite driving habits or commutes better handled by sedans.</p>
    <p>No. If you want one, you have to feed the beast. It likes to be fed. It likes 
    eating nice long straight-aways and corners; it loves to go brute fast and crazy. 
    Take care of the 8.3-liter, V10 engine and it will show you the joys of 510 
    horsepower and 535 lb.-ft. of torque, will take you to places within yourself 
    that you didn’t know existed, unleashing a cocktail of thrill, fear and oh-my-god 
    adrenaline, straighten your tie and punch you in the chest. Clearly, this is 
    not a car for any commute except for the one that takes you to a track. Indeed, 
    even entertaining the idea of a commute is like taking Uncle Buck to a museum. 
    Try it and people will stare, and it’s obvious from the looks that one of two 
    thoughts is coursing through the noggin of the guy next to you at the light:
    <i>you’ve got to be kidding me, that dude must be over compensating</i> and
    <i>dang, if I could only get one green light behind the wheel of that beast…</i></p>
    <p>There’s a simple solution: to drive the Viper is to make a commitment to 
    your local track, or at least some nice open road in the boondocks, simply because 
    this car is not engineered for transportation: it’s built to go like the dickens 
    and that’s exactly what it does, with a bite of asphalt and a hungry, burbling 
    roar. To my driving experience, there is nothing as powerful in a straight line; 
    dip into that torque band and prepare to feel an incredible surge of power from 
    the Viper’s 13.6-inch rear tires. Zero to sixty feels like a slingshot, and 
    it’s easy to believe Dodge’s claim of less than four seconds. Brakes are sensitive 
    and gripping: those big brakes bring the coupe back to zero very quickly, with 
    no fade. The ride is sports car harsh, of course, and not one to be stuck in 
    any kind of gridlock. Drive this car at five o’clock on a work day and you get 
    the cramps you deserve for being a bit of a nincompoop. It’s easier than you’d 
    think to cycle through the six-speed manual transmission; it’s a heavy shifter, 
    to be sure, but friendly enough to not hamper the driving experience. And what 
    an experience! It’s just too much power on public roads, and while handling 
    is incredible – those wide tires provide plenty of stick to the ground – the 
    pure, raw nature of this car leaves little room for mistakes, and those mistakes 
    will be much, much more serious than a little fender damage. I didn’t drive 
    on the track, so pushing it to the limit was out of the question. But what mild 
    cornering I did do in the Viper produced oversteer. </p>
    <p>So be warned. The bottom line? God Bless Dodge for building this car as they 
    did. Curse them, too, because to drive it on a public road was a dicey experience 
    that I, for one, don’t ever care to repeat. And even with that, after my taste 
    of the Viper all I could think of – for two days – was to get it back, find 
    a track and rip into this beast with both hands.</p>
    <p><b>Ron Perry’s 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe Driving Impressions:</b><br>
    The beauty of this car is that the Dodge Viper Coupe spits in the face of convention. 
    While every other manufacturer is refining their cars by isolating the driver 
    from the driving experience, Dodge has left the Viper alone. It doesn’t pretend 
    to be anything other than what it is, a muscle car. From the minute you push 
    the red start button and the engine springs to life, your primal senses tell 
    you that you’re behind the wheel of a serious machine. From the loping of the 
    engine at idle, to the burble and popping sound the exhaust makes when backing 
    off the throttle, the Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe brings a smile to your face that 
    is hard to erase. </p>
    <p>Mash the accelerator and the Dodge Viper SRT-10 lunges forward with alarming 
    speed. Give it too much throttle in a corner and the Viper will bite you. With 
    all of the torque the Viper possesses, it will break the rear loose faster than 
    you can mutter your favorite swear word. Oversteer is easily counteracted and 
    controlled. Steering is quick and precise and transmits to the driver a feeling 
    of stability and control. Between the great engine and the exceptional handling, 
    the Viper easily allowed cornering at twice the posted limit on my run with 
    little effort and without approaching the car’s limits. Stopping isn’t a concern 
    either. The Viper’s brakes relay everything the driver need to know.</p>
    <p>This car has quickly become one of my favorites to drive because of its adherence 
    to the original intention of the Viper. The car’s rawness is exciting and the 
    experience of driving the Viper is one of being in a racecar minus the roll 
    cage and helmet. It is just a hoot to drive.</p>

    </p>
    <p><b>Christian Wardlaw’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Comfort:</b><br>
    Getting in and out of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe is not easy. The door 
    openings are very tight, the sills are very wide (and hot after driving the 
    car), and the seats are mounted low and deeply bolstered. But once you get situated 
    behind the steering wheel, you’ll find that the seats are close to perfection 
    unless you’re morbidly obese. The three-spoke steering wheel is thick and pleasing 
    to grip, designed for use at the ten-and-two as well as the nine-and-three hand 
    positions. The baseball-sized shift knob falls right in your hand, and padded 
    armrests sit at the same height on both sides (though the one on the driver’s 
    door is <i>thinly</i> padded).</p>
    <p>On a warm day, you need to run the air conditioning. Heat coming from the 
    center drivetrain tunnel can bake occupants; thankfully temperatures were in 
    the 50s and 60s when I drove the Viper. Despite the inclusion of Alpine speakers 
    mounted between the seats, the stereo has trouble compensating for engine and 
    exhaust notes, wind noise, and road texture. Better to leave the stereo turned 
    off. Pop the rear hatch, and you’ll be surprised to find that there’s useable 
    trunk space. Not as much as you’ll find in a Corvette, but then, the liftover 
    height into the Viper is much lower than its closest competitor.</p>
    <p><b>Thom Blackett’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Comfort:</b><br>
    Think of that plush sofa that you fall into after every hard day of work, the 
    cozy sectional on which you lounge watching movies all weekend and seem to find 
    so perfectly suitable for impromptu naps. Now imagine using a machete to hack 
    away every bit of fluffy cushion, leaving only the hard and unforgiving wooden 
    frame, the one that requires you to conform to its shape rather than vice versa. 
    And then picture that back breaker in a small box. </p>
    <p>Welcome to the driver’s seat of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe. This is 
    the perfect car for proponents of an age restriction on driving – there’s no 
    way an arthritic grandparent is dreaming of getting into this automotive capsule, 
    let alone putting up with the firm and overstuffed side bolsters or spine-tingling 
    ride that comes from traversing even smooth pavement. However, for the exclusive 
    shopper seeking a ride that will keep all body parts firmly locked down in high-speed 
    corners, puts the thickly-padded steering wheel and shift knob in their ideal 
    positions, and offers adjustable foot pedals for a perfect fit, the gruff Viper’s 
    lack of finesse is actually desirable. </p>
    <p><b>Brian Chee’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Comfort:</b><br>
    If you buy the 2006 Dodge Viper and expect to find comfort, get your head examined. 
    Interior room is cramped, the cabin runs hot, heat comes up from the transmission 
    tunnel into the passenger compartment, and the sill exhaust covers are conveniently 
    located where you want to place your leg when getting out. The Viper’s seats 
    are a little tight, fore and aft seat adjustment is limited, and the two seats 
    are separated by a large center tunnel that takes up too much room – pushing 
    the seats out and compromising shoulder room. Getting in is no treat, either, 
    because it’s so low-slung. </p>
    <p>There’s a nice idea. Once you clamber inside, the good things about comfort 
    are all driver-oriented. The pedals are adjustable, the steering wheel feels 
    nice and meaty, and the seats are perfectly supportive. But movable pedals aside, 
    if you’re tall you will not enjoy this car, nor will you if you’re wider than 
    a normal American male, thanks to those really supportive seats and limited 
    room for movement. Pedal play is designed for aggressive driving, as the pedals 
    are close together and take some getting used to. Comfortable, this isn&#39;t – 
    but it’s also not painful, just a pain, and takes us back to where we write 
    that if you buy this car and intend to drive it everyday, well, you should get 
    your head examined. Used for aggressive driving on a track, however, you’re 
    unlikely to notice the comfort compromises implicit in the Viper’s design.</p>
    <p><b>Ron Perry’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Comfort:</b><br>
    Getting in and out of the Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe takes a little getting used 
    to. Developing your own contortions to make entering and exiting easier is just 
    part of the ownership requirement. Once you have dropped into the form fitting 
    seats, you find the sides and bottom to be well bolstered and the center console 
    is at just the right height to rest your right arm and work the shifter. The 
    white-faced gauges are a little small and hard to read but the vertical stack 
    of gauges on the left side of the console for oil pressure and temperature, 
    water temperature and battery couldn’t be any better placed. </p>
    <p>The ride is firm but nothing other than what you would expect from a sports 
    car in this league. The cabin is tight and formed around the occupants, as a 
    sports car should be, but the downside to the Viper’s interior is the heat that 
    infiltrates through the floorboard and transmission tunnel. It feels as though 
    the heater is always on but you can’t sense any direct airflow. If Dodge could 
    do away with the interior heat issue, there would be little left to complain 
    about.</p>

    <p><b>Christian Wardlaw’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Quality:</b><br>
    Compared to the original Dodge Viper GTS, this new 2006 version is a paragon 
    of refinement. By contemporary standards, however, the Viper Coupe’s Chrysler 
    minivan stereo and climate controls, parts bin stalks and switches, cheaply 
    upholstered visors, and pillar trim that comes off in your hands make you wonder 
    why you spent so much for so little. Some of that coin went into the leather 
    and suede racing seats complete with provisions for a racing harness. Some of 
    it went into the metal trim used for the door releases and handles, and the 
    surround for the gear shift. Nearly every dash and door panel is soft to the 
    touch, and the hard plastics have a rubbery matte finish. Many of my peers claim 
    the Viper’s interior is full of cheap materials. It’s not true.</p>
    <p>Exterior build quality is terrific. The gaps are larger than say, a Porsche, 
    but everything fits properly and lines up right. The 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 
    Coupe is a huge improvement over the first-gen model in this regard. The interior 
    is also much better than the old car, despite the sloppy fit of the plastic 
    pillar covers, the non-flush fit of the glove box door, and a somewhat loose 
    headliner at its leading edge. The relative lack of rattles and squeaks inside 
    our test car was testament to this improved build quality.</p>
    <p><b>Thom Blackett’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Quality:</b><br>
    True, it may ring up at nearly $90,000, but buying a Viper for its quality craftsmanship 
    is like buying a Sports Illustrated calendar to keep track of your appointments 
    – there’s no big mystery about why these are the same buyers who continue to 
    buoy the sale of belated birthday cards. </p>
    <p>The 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe is a rip-roaring modern day muscle car 
    with primary functions to go very fast, handle a twisty race track like it’s 
    second nature, and act as the best possible conduit between driver and road, 
    all of which it does very well. Above and beyond that, this ride is well-built, 
    with soft-touch plastics used throughout the interior, and large but consistent 
    panel gaps inside and out. </p>
    <p><b>Brian Chee’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Quality:</b><br>
    Five hundred and ten horsepower. Five hundred and thirty five lb.-ft of torque. 
    All you need to know about quality lies under the hood: an aluminum block, 8.3-liter 
    V10 engine, mated to a six-speed manual transmission and driving wide rear tires. 
    If you expect soft touches and creature comforts from a Viper, well, you fail 
    to understand the raw appeal of the car. For more than 80 grand, you get what 
    you pay for, as long as brute power and a look-at-me design is what you want. 
    In terms of gaps and interior materials, the Viper is nicely assembled – it’s 
    not like they have two shifts building these things. Inside, the controls have 
    nice heft, seat material feels durable and comfortable, and plastics are acceptable. 
    Then again, it’s hard to pay too much attention when you’re driving a Viper 
    – the driving demands your complete attention.</p>
    <p><b>Ron Perry’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Quality:</b><br>
    Aside from the heat issue in the cabin already mentioned, the only other thing 
    that caught my attention was lifter noise from the engine bay. Body panels are 
    smooth and paint is devoid of orange peel. Fit and finish appears excellent 
    and the interior pieces are of acceptable quality. The only piece I would question 
    is the flap on the ashtray mounted on the center console. This is a flimsy plastic 
    piece that undoubtedly will break with minor use. Don’t expect to find a place 
    for your latte in the Viper, the only place for it will be between your legs.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p><b>Christian Wardlaw’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Design:</b><br>
    Something about the rounded shapes of the original Viper appeal more to me than 
    this sharply creased model, but clearly the 2006 Coupe is a terrific-looking 
    automobile. The view over the hood is particularly appealing, with a power dome 
    hood flanked by sharp-edged fenders. Vents emit hot air from the engine bay, 
    rippling the forward view at idle. The Viper’s polished alloy wheels, deeply 
    sculpted body sides, curvaceous rear end, and yes, even the racing stripes, 
    all give this Dodge more character and presence than the relatively tame Corvette 
    Z06. Inside, the minimalist design and décor is punctuated by beautiful white 
    gauges, exposed allen-head screws, and metal trim. No longer does the Viper’s 
    cabin appear to be the result of a home-built amalgam of unrelated bits and 
    pieces.</p>
    <p><b>Thom Blackett’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Design:</b><br>
    Any other car with the cross-haired front fascia, domed hood with angled slits, 
    and deep front fender vents would conjure up thoughts of a Pontiac Fiero/Ferrari 
    body kit project gone horribly wrong. But it works on the Viper, and only improves 
    with the addition of the double-bubble hardtop and sloped rear glass, though 
    that tail end, with the lights wrapping in under the quarter panels, looks a 
    little odd. Thankfully, other design elements steal the eye’s attention, such 
    as the integrated rear diffuser, the side exhaust outlets, and those almighty 
    five-spoke, 19-inch wheels out back and 18s up front. </p>
    <p>Inside, despite the leather and suede upholstery and soft-touch plastics, 
    the Viper screams race car for the street. A huge white-faced tachometer resides 
    next to the speedometer, the shift knob sits in an optimal position, and relevant 
    gauges are lined up neatly on the instrument panel, allowing for a quick check 
    between apexes. </p>
    <p><b>Brian Chee’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Design:</b><br>
    The Dodge Viper looks as it is: a beautiful beast with no patience for commutes 
    or errands. The long hood, the bubble roof, the racing stripes, the bright paint, 
    and the wide back-end all tell a story of brute strength and flash, of going 
    faster than polite people like to go and of making more of a show than humble 
    people find appropriate. Heck, away from the track, it’s an inappropriate car, 
    with its overtly aggressive design and V10 engine. This is a no-apologies type 
    of car, and the design reflects its in-your-face attitude. Park it on your street 
    and people will either come over right away to admire it, or whisper derisive 
    things to their wives about you. </p>
    <p>The interior design follows the same theme: on the track, it all makes sense, 
    from the push button ignition, to the steering wheel and the instrumentation 
    layout. The tachometer, for example, is front and center, as it should be. Gauges 
    are in-your-face and that big, meaty shifter sits up like a club.</p>
    <p><b>Ron Perry’s Opinion of the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe’s Design:</b><br>
    As the design of the Dodge Viper has progressed, the lines have become stretched 
    and less curvaceous. It is still a design that screams speed and muscle, but 
    in my opinion doesn’t look as good as the original Viper design. Gone are the 
    calf burning exposed side pipes from the original car that gave the Viper its 
    real muscle car appearance. The exhaust pipes on the new car still travel the 
    same route but are now covered with body colored panels. They still get hot 
    but don’t leave you with a nasty souvenir every time you exit the cabin. Other 
    cues from the original, but modernized, include the wraparound taillights, deep 
    side scallops and crosshair grille. Our test car was red with silver racing 
    stripes that really added to the Viper’s exotic mystique.</p>

    <p><b>Christian Wardlaw’s Advice about the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe:</b><br>
    A skilled driver will enjoy driving the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe on favorite 
    back roads, but will certainly thrill to slam it around a closed track. Unskilled 
    drivers, well, we’ve all seen the photos on wreckedexotics.com, haven’t we? 
    Bottom line: I loved driving the Viper, which demands attention, drives like 
    a track-ready racer, and is completely impractical. A car like this should never 
    be used as a daily driver, and though the Corvette Z06 is equally capable in 
    many ways, its docile nature and user-friendliness leaves me cold in comparison. 
    The 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe never lets you forget you’re behind the wheel 
    of something unique, something temperamental, something that could bite you 
    hard if you’re not paying attention. It is an exciting car to drive at all times, 
    a car in which you would never consider wolfing down a Quarter Pounder with 
    Cheese while yakking on a cell phone. The Viper Coupe is what a sports car
    <i>should</i> be.</p>
    <p><b>Thom Blackett’s Advice about the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe:</b><br>
    Affluent poseurs, do yourself and society a favor by steering clear of the 2006 
    Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe.</p>
    <p>This is a car for serious and extremely capable drivers. There’s just too 
    much power here for the average Joe with $90,000 laying around to enjoy on Saturday 
    morning jaunts or to attempt burnouts at the local Starbucks. That’s not a challenge 
    to you; rather an educated understanding that the majority of the buying public 
    is outmatched by this car’s potential, especially given the lack of traction 
    or stability control. In the wrong hands, or sometimes even in the right hands, 
    the unyielding Viper can teach a harsh lesson. But with the right driver and 
    the right road (or track), Dodge’s super car is an amazing machine that will 
    run as hard and as far as you dare to push it. </p>
    <p><b>Brian Chee’s Advice about the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe:</b><br>
    Raise your hand and repeat after me: <i>I swear on my standing as a gear head 
    to take my Viper to a track often, and to never, ever, drive it aggressively 
    on a public road.</i> Do that, and go ahead – have fun. The Viper is loaded 
    with speed and driving excellence; it’s a raw, no-compromise car for people 
    who like to play with raw power. Just don’t plan it as a daily driver. In traffic, 
    on the way to the store or to work, the Viper is like having a shiner: no one 
    wants to say anything, but everyone still stares as you go on by. For those 
    of you who might be entering the difficult, soul-searching middle years, always 
    dreamed of owning a sports car, and don’t even know where the local track is, 
    do yourself a favor and think twice. This car, with this power, is like jumping 
    on a rocket and lighting the fuse. It’s quite a ride, but one you want to come 
    back from.</p>
    <p><b>Ron Perry’s Advice about the 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10 Coupe:</b><br>
    If you are in a position to purchase a car of this nature, why not?! The only 
    downside I can see is the high cost compared to other cars in this category, 
    but then again, exclusivity doesn’t come cheap.</p>
