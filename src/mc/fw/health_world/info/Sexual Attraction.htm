      <p align="center">It&#39;s a natural part of life to have sexual feelings. As people 
      pass from childhood, through adolescence, to adulthood, their sexual feelings 
      develop and change.</p>
      <h3>Adolescence Is a Time of Change</h3>
      <p>During the teen years, sexual feelings are awakened in new ways because 
      of the hormonal and physical changes of puberty. These changes involve both 
      the body and the mind, and teens may wonder about new — and often intense 
      — sexual feelings.</p>
      <p>It takes time for many people to understand who they are and who they&#39;re 
      becoming. Part of that understanding includes a person&#39;s sexual feelings and 
      attractions.</p>
      <p>The term sexual orientation refers to the gender (that is, male or female) 
      to which a person is attracted. There are several types of sexual orientation 
      that are commonly described:</p>
      <ul class="kh_longline_list">
        <li><strong>Heterosexual.</strong> People who are heterosexual are romantically 
        and physically attracted to members of the opposite sex: Heterosexual males 
        are attracted to females, and heterosexual females are attracted to males. 
        Heterosexuals are sometimes called &quot;straight.&quot; </li>
        <li><strong>Homosexual.</strong> People who are homosexual are romantically 
        and physically attracted to people of the same sex: Females who are attracted 
        to other females are lesbian; males who are attracted to other males are 
        often known as gay. (The term gay is sometimes also used to describe homosexual 
        individuals of either gender.) </li>
        <li><strong>Bisexual.</strong> People who are bisexual are romantically 
        and physically attracted to members of both sexes. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Teens — both guys and girls — often find themselves having sexual thoughts 
      and attractions. For some, these feelings and thoughts can be intense — and 
      even confusing or disturbing. That may be especially true for people who are 
      having romantic or sexual thoughts about someone who is the same sex they 
      are. &quot;What does that mean,&quot; they might think. &quot;Am I gay?&quot;</p>
      <p>Thinking sexually about both the same sex and the opposite sex is quite 
      common as people sort through their emerging sexual feelings. This type of 
      imagining about people of the same or opposite sex doesn&#39;t necessarily mean 
      that a person fits into a particular type of sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>Some teens may also experiment with sexual experiences, including those 
      with members of the same sex, during the years they are exploring their own 
      sexuality. These experiences, by themselves, do not necessarily mean that 
      a person is gay or straight.</p>
      <h3>Do People Choose Their Sexual Orientation?</h3>
      <p>Most medical professionals, including organizations such as the American 
      Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, believe 
      that sexual orientation involves a complex mixture of biology, psychology, 
      and environmental factors. A person&#39;s genes and inborn hormonal factors may 
      play a role as well. These medical professionals believe that — in most cases 
      — sexual orientation, whatever its causes, is not simply chosen.</p>
      <p>Not everyone agrees. Some believe that individuals can choose who they 
      are attracted to — and that people who are gay have chosen to be attracted 
      to people of the same gender. No matter what someone&#39;s sexual orientation 
      is, in some cases it may be affected by the life experiences that person has 
      had.</p>
      <p>
      <img class="right" src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/Sexual%20Attraction/Stereotypes.gif" align="right" width="195" height="185"></p>
      <p>There are lots of opinions and stereotypes about sexual orientation, though, 
      and some of these can be hurtful to people of all orientations. For example, 
      having a more &quot;feminine&quot; appearance or interest does not mean that a guy is 
      gay. And having a more &quot;masculine&quot; appearance doesn&#39;t mean a girl is lesbian. 
      As with most things, making assumptions just based on looks can lead to the 
      wrong conclusion.</p>
      <h3>What&#39;s It Like for Gay Teens?</h3>
      <p>For many people who are gay or lesbian, it can feel like everyone is expected 
      to be straight. Because of this, some gay and lesbian teens may feel different 
      from their friends when the heterosexual people around them start talking 
      about romantic feelings, dating, and sex. They may feel like they have to 
      pretend to feel things that they don&#39;t in order to fit. They might feel they 
      need to deny who they are or that they have to hide an important part of themselves.</p>
      <p>These feelings, plus fears of prejudice, can lead people who aren&#39;t straight 
      to keep their sexual orientation secret, even from friends and family who 
      might be supportive.</p>
      <p>Some gay or lesbian teens tell a few accepting, supportive friends and 
      family members about their sexual orientation. This is often called coming 
      out.</p>
      <p>Many lesbian, gay, and bisexual teens who come out to their friends and 
      families are fully accepted by them and their communities. They feel comfortable 
      about being attracted to someone of the same gender and don&#39;t feel anxious 
      about it.</p>
      <p>But not everyone has the same feelings or good support systems. People 
      who feel they need to hide who they are or who fear rejection, discrimination, 
      or violence can be at greater risk for emotional problems like anxiety and 
      depression.</p>
      <p>Some gay teens without support systems can be at higher risk than heterosexual 
      teens for dropping out of school, living on the streets, using alcohol and 
      drugs, and even in some cases for attempting to harm themselves.</p>
      <p>These difficulties are thought to happen more frequently not directly because 
      they are gay, but because gay and lesbian people are more likely to be misunderstood, 
      socially isolated, or mistreated because of their sexual orientation.</p>
      <p>This doesn&#39;t happen to all gay teens, of course. Many gay and lesbian teens 
      and their families have no more difficulties during the teen years than anyone 
      else.</p>
      <h3>The Importance of Talking</h3>
      <p>No matter what someone&#39;s sexual orientation is, learning about sexuality 
      and relationships can be difficult. It can help to talk to someone about the 
      confusing feelings that go with growing up, perhaps a parent or other family 
      member, a close friend or sibling, or a school counselor. It&#39;s not always 
      easy to find somebody to talk to, but many people find that confiding in someone 
      they trust and feel close to, even if they&#39;re not completely sure how that 
      person will react, turns out to be a positive experience.</p>
      <p>
      <img class="right" src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/Sexual%20Attraction/FindingAConfidant.gif" align="right" width="195" height="185"></p>
      <p>In many communities, resources such as youth groups composed of teens who 
      are facing similar issues can provide opportunities for people to talk to 
      others who understand. Psychologists, psychiatrists, family doctors, and trained 
      counselors can help teens cope — confidentially and privately — with the difficult 
      feelings that go with their developing sexuality. These experts can also help 
      teens to find ways to deal with any peer pressure, harassment, and bullying 
      they may face.</p>
      <p>Whether gay, straight, bisexual, or just not sure, almost all teens have 
      questions about physically maturing and about sexual health (for example, 
      avoiding <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/stds/std.html">
      STDs</a>). It&#39;s important to find a
      <a href="http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/medical_care/talk_doctor.html">
      doctor</a> or health professional to discuss these issues with — someone who 
      can provide reliable health advice.</p>
      <p>Although sexual feelings and behavior are important parts of human development, 
      there are still many unanswered questions about human sexuality. Researchers 
      are constantly learning new information, and undoubtedly people will know 
      more about sexual orientation in the coming years.</p>
