      Welcome to the <i>Physics Glossary</i>. Here you will find many different 
      terms used in Physics.<p><font color="#880000"><b>Acceleration</b></font><br>
      Objects that are changing their speed or their direction are said to be accelerating. 
      The rate at which the speed or direction changes is referred to as acceleration. 
      Some amusement park rides (such as roller coasters) are characterized by rapid 
      changes in speed and or direction. These rides have large accelerations. Rides 
      such as the carousel result in small accelerations; the speed and direction 
      of the riders change gradually.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Balanced And Unbalanced Forces</b></font><br>
      A balanced force results whenever two or more forces act upon an object in 
      such a way as to exactly counteract each other. As you sit in your seat at 
      this moment, the seat pushes upward with a force equal in strength and opposite 
      in direction to the force of gravity. These two forces are said to balance 
      each other, causing you to remain at rest. If the seat is suddenly pulled 
      out from under you, then you experience an unbalanced force. There is no longer 
      an upward seat force to balance the downward pull of gravity, so you accelerate 
      to the ground.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Centripetal force</b></font><br>
      Motion along a curve or through a circle is always caused by a centripetal 
      force. This is a force that pushes an object in an inward direction. The moon 
      orbits the earth in a circular motion because a force of gravity pulls on 
      the moon in an inward direction toward the center of its orbit. In a roller 
      coaster loop, riders are pushed inwards toward the center of the loop by forces 
      resulting from the car seat (at the loop&#39;s bottom) and by gravity (at the 
      loop&#39;s top).</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Energy</b></font><br>
      Energy comes in many forms. The two most important forms for amusement park 
      rides are kinetic energy and potential energy. In the absence of external 
      forces such as air resistance and friction (two of many), the total amount 
      of an object&#39;s energy remains constant. On a coaster ride, energy is rapidly 
      transformed from potential energy to kinetic energy when falling and from 
      kinetic energy to potential energy when rising. Yet the total amount of energy 
      remains constant.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Force</b></font><br>
      A force is a push or a pull acting upon an object. Forces result from interactions 
      between two objects. Most interactions involve contact. If you hit the wall, 
      the wall hits you back. The contact interaction between your hand and the 
      wall results in a mutual push upon both objects. The wall becomes nicked (if 
      hit hard enough) and your hand hurts. Bumper cars experience mutual forces 
      acting between them due to contact during a collision. Some forces can act 
      from a distance without actual contact between the two interacting objects. 
      Gravity is one such force. On a free fall ride, there is a force of gravitational 
      attraction between the Earth and your body even though the Earth and your 
      body are not in contact. </p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Friction</b></font><br>
      Friction is a force that resists the motion of an object. Friction results 
      from the close interaction between two surfaces that are sliding across each 
      other. When you slam on your brakes and your car skids to a stop with locked 
      wheels, it is the force of friction that brings it to a stop. Friction resists 
      the car&#39;s motion.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>G</b></font><br>
      A g is a unit of acceleration equal to the acceleration caused by gravity. 
      Gravity causes free-falling objects on the Earth to change their speeds at 
      rates of about 10 m/s each second. That would be equivalent to a change in 
      speed of 32 ft/s in each consecutive second. If an object is said to experience 
      3 g&#39;s of acceleration, then the object is changing its speed at a rate of 
      about 30 m/s every second.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Gravitational Force</b></font><br>
      Any two objects with mass attract each other with a type of force known as 
      a gravitational force. The strength of this force depends upon the mass of 
      the two objects and the distance between them. For objects with masses as 
      large as the earth and the sun, these forces are sizeable and have tremendous 
      influence upon the subsequent motion. For objects such as two persons sitting 
      in a theater, the force of gravitational attraction is so small that it is 
      insignificant. In order for such persons to increase the force of attraction 
      between them, they must add to their mass (maybe by eating more popcorn). 
      Objects on the earth experience noticeable attractions with the earth due 
      to the earth&#39;s large mass.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Inertia</b></font><br>
      Inertia is a tendency of an object to resist change in its state of motion. 
      More massive objects have more inertia; that is, they have more tendency to 
      resist changes in the way they are moving. An elephant has a lot of inertia, 
      for example. If it is at rest, it offers a large resistance to changes in 
      its state of rest, and so it&#39;s difficult to move an elephant. On the other 
      hand, a pencil has a small amount of inertia. It&#39;s easy to move a pencil from 
      its state of rest. More massive objects have more inertia and thus require 
      more force in order to change their state of motion.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Kinetic energy</b></font><br>
      Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object because of its motion. 
      All moving objects have kinetic energy. The amount of kinetic energy depends 
      upon the mass and speed of the object. A roller coaster car has a lot of kinetic 
      energy if it is moving fast and has a lot of mass. In general, the kinetic 
      energy of a roller coaster rider is at a maximum when the rider reaches a 
      minimum height.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Mass</b></font><br>
      The mass of an object is a measurement of the amount of material in a substance. 
      Mass refers to how much &quot;stuff&quot; is there. Elephants are very massive, since 
      they contain a lot of &quot;stuff.&quot;</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Momentum</b></font><br>
      Momentum pertains to the quantity of motion that an object possesses. Any 
      mass that is in motion has momentum. In fact, momentum depends upon mass and 
      velocity, or in other words, the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; that is moving and how 
      fast the &quot;stuff&quot; is moving. A train of roller coaster cars moving at a high 
      speed has a lot of momentum. A tennis ball moving at a high speed has less 
      momentum. And the building you are in, despite its large mass, has no momentum 
      since it is at rest.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion</b></font><br>
      An object at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line will remain at rest 
      or in the same uniform motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This 
      is also known as the law of inertia.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Newton&#39;s Second Law of Motion</b></font><br>
      The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the total unbalanced 
      force exerted on the object, and is inversely proportional to the mass of 
      the object (in other words, as mass increases, the acceleration has to decrease). 
      The acceleration of an object moves in the same direction as the total force. 
      This is also known as the law of acceleration.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Newton&#39;s Third Law of Motion</b></font><br>
      If one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts 
      a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the object body. This 
      is also known as the law of interaction.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Period</b></font><br>
      A motion that repeats itself in cyclic fashion is said to be periodic. The 
      time for one complete cycle is known as the period of the motion. The motion 
      of a second hand has a period of 60 seconds. The periodic rotation of the 
      earth about its axis is 24 hours. The periodic motion of an amusement park 
      pendulum ride may have a period as high as 10 or 15 seconds.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Potential energy</b></font><br>
      Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object because of its height 
      above the ground. The amount of potential energy possessed by an object depends 
      on its mass and its height. A roller coaster car is initially hauled by a 
      motor and chain system to the top of a tall hill, giving it a large quantity 
      of potential energy.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Speed</b></font><br>
      Speed is a measurement of how fast an object is moving. Fast-moving objects 
      can cover large distances in a small amount of time. They are said to have 
      a high speed. A roller coaster car moving at 60 miles per hour would be able 
      to cover a distance of 60 miles in one hour if it could maintain this pace.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Velocity</b></font><br>
      The velocity of an object refers to the speed and direction in which it moves. 
      If you drive north to your work place and your speedometer reads 35 miles 
      per hour, then your velocity is 35 miles per hour in a northward direction. 
      Velocity is speed with a direction and is important in understanding bumper 
      car collisions.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Weight</b></font><br>
      Weight is a measurement of the gravitational force acting on an object. The 
      weight of an object is expressed in pounds in the U.S. A 180-pound person 
      is experiencing a force of gravitational attraction to the earth equal to 
      180 pounds.</p>
      <p><font color="#880000"><b>Weightlessness</b></font><br>
      Amusement park rides often produce sensations of weightlessness. These sensations 
      result when riders no longer feel an external force acting upon their bodies. 
      At the top of the tower of a free-fall ride, a 100-pound rider would feel 
      100 pounds of force from the seat pushing as an external force upon her body. 
      The rider feels her normal weight. Yet, as she falls from the tower, the seat 
      has fallen out from under her. She no longer feels the external force of the 
      seat and subsequently has a brief sensation of weightlessness. She has not 
      lost any weight, but feels as though she has because of the absence of the 
      seat force. In this context, weightlessness is a sensation and not an actual 
      change in weight.</p>
