<h3 align="center">To you, O Sun, the people of Dorian Rhodes set up this bronze 
statue reaching to Olympus when they had pacified the waves of war and crowned their 
city with the spoils taken from the enemy. Not only over the seas but also on land 
did they kindle the lovely torch of freedom.</h3>

<p>From its building to its destruction lies a time span of merely 56 years. Yet 
the colossus earned a place in the famous list of Wonders. &quot;But even lying on the 
ground, it is a marvel&quot;, said Pliny the Elder. The Colossus of Rhodes was not only 
a gigantic statue. It was rather a symbol of unity of the people who inhabited that 
beautiful Mediterranean island -- Rhodes. </p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>At the entrance of the harbor of the Mediterranean island of
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/greece/rhodes_island/">Rhodes</a> in
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/greece/">Greece</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout most of its history, ancient Greece was comprised of city-states which 
had limited power beyond their boundary. On the small island of Rhodes were three 
of these: Ialysos, Kamiros, and Lindos. In 408 BC, the cities united to form one 
territory, with a unified capital, Rhodes. The city thrived commercially and had 
strong economic ties with their main ally, Ptolemy I Soter of
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/index.html">Egypt</a>. In 305 BC, the Antigonids 
of Macedonia who were also rivals of the
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/Alexandria/History/ptolemaic.html">Ptolemies</a>, 
besieged Rhodes in an attempt to break the Rhodo-Egyptian alliance. They could never 
penetrate the city. When a peace agreement was reached in 304 BC, the Antagonids 
lifted the siege, leaving a wealth of military equipment behind. To celebrate their 
unity, the Rhodians sold the equipment and used the money to erect an enormous statue 
of their sun god, Helios. </p>
<p>The construction of the Colossus took 12 years and was finished in 282 BC. For 
years, the statue stood at the harbor entrance, until a strong earthquake hit Rhodes 
about 226 BC. The city was badly damaged, and the Colossus was broken at its weakest 
point -- the knee. The Rhodians received an immediate offer from Ptolemy III Eurgetes 
of Egypt to cover all restoration costs for the toppled monument. However, an oracle 
was consulted and forbade the re-erection. Ptolemy&#39;s offer was declined. </p>
<p>For almost a millennium, the statue lay broken in ruins. In AD 654, the Arabs 
invaded Rhodes. They disassembled the remains of the broken Colossus and sold them 
to a Jew from Syria. It is said that the fragments had to be transported to Syria 
on the backs of 900 camels. </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Let us first clear a misconception about the appearance of the Colossus. It has 
long been believed that the Colossus stood in front of the Mandraki harbor, one 
of many in the city of Rhodes, straddling its entrance. Given the height of the 
statue and the width of the harbor mouth, this picture is rather impossible than 
improbable. Moreover, the fallen Colossus would have blocked the harbor entrance. 
Recent studies suggest that it was erected either on the eastern promontory of the 
Mandraki harbor, or even further inland. Anyway, it did never straddle the harbor 
entrance. </p>
<p>The project was commissioned by the Rhodian sculptor Chares of Lindos. To build 
the statue, his workers cast the outer bronze skin parts. The base was made of white 
marble, and the feet and ankle of the statue were first fixed. The structure was 
gradually erected as the bronze form was fortified with an iron and stone framework. 
To reach the higher parts, an earth ramp was built around the statue and was later 
removed. When the colossus was finished, it stood about 33 m (110 ft) high. And 
when it fell, &quot;few people can make their arms meet round the thumb&quot;, wrote Pliny.
</p>
<p>Although we do not know the true shape and appearance of the Colossus,
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/colossus_new.jpg">modern reconstructions</a> 
with the statue standing upright are more accurate than
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/colossus_bw1.jpg">older drawings</a>. 
Although it disappeared from existence, the ancient World Wonder inspired modern 
artists such as French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi best known by his famous work:

Liberty</a>.</p>
