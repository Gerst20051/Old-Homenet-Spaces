<p>You can help prevent tetanus by having all of your recommended immunizations. 
There are three different combination immunizations that include a vaccine for tetanus.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>DTaP</b> (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis). This immunization is given 
  in a series of five shots beginning at age 2 months and ending between ages 4 
  and 6 years.</li>
  <li><b>Tdap</b> (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis). This is the first booster 
  shot for tetanus and is recommended for children between ages 11 and 12 years 
  who have completed the DTaP vaccination series. Teens or adults who have never 
  had the Tdap vaccine should talk to their doctors about getting it for their next 
  tetanus booster.</li>
  <li><b>Td</b> (tetanus and diphtheria). This vaccine is given as a booster shot 
  every 10 years. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a dirty cut or wound and have not had a tetanus shot in the last 
5 years, have a tetanus shot within 48 hours. Some people may need tetanus immune 
globulin (TIG) for a wound that is at high risk for developing tetanus. The immune 
globulin is usually only needed if you have not (or do not know whether you have) 
completed the tetanus vaccination series.</p>
<p>Tetanus immunization protects against tetanus (lockjaw), a bacterial infection 
that can occur when tetanus bacteria get in a wound (break in the skin or mucous 
membrane). Tetanus bacteria usually are found in the soil, especially dirty areas, 
such as areas with animal feces. The dirtier the wound, the higher the risk of tetanus. 
However, tetanus can also develop in a clean wound.</p>
<p>Tetanus bacteria enter the body through skin wounds and thrive only in the absence 
of oxygen. So, the deeper and narrower the wound and the less oxygen around the 
wound, the greater the possibility of tetanus. Preventing tetanus infection is important, 
because tetanus is often fatal.</p>
<h4>Tetanus shot reaction</h4>
<p>Occasionally an individual will have a localized reaction to a tetanus shot. 
Symptoms include warmth, swelling, and redness at the injection site. A fever of 
up to 100 °F(37.8 °C) may occur. Home treatment can help reduce the discomfort.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a nonprescription medication for pain and fever. Do not give aspirin 
  to anyone younger than age 20 unless it is prescribed by a health professional.</li>
  <li>Apply an ice pack to the injection site for 20 minutes, 3 or 4 times a day 
  for the first 24 to 48 hours. After 48 hours, heat may feel better.</li>
