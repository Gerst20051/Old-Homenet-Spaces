          this computer might attract other buyers and so placed an advertisement 
          in the hobbyist magazine “Popular Electronics,” offering it in kit form. 
          The IMSAI 8080, as it was known, sold briskly and eventually about 20,000 
          units were shipped. The company was eventually purchased by one of its

          is founded. In 1980, brothers Doug and Gary Carlston formed a company 
          to market the games Doug had created. Their first games were Galactic 
          Empire, Galactic Trader and Galactic Revolution. They continued to have 
          success with popular games such as Myst (1993) and Riven (1997) and a

          is founded. Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC) was formed by MIT graduate

          Their idea was to use many individual processors of moderate power rather 
          than one extremely powerful processor. Their first machine, called The 
          Connection Machine (CM-1), had 64,000 microprocessors, and began shipping 
          in 1986. TMC later produced several larger computers with more powerful—the 
          CM-2 and CM-5. Competition from more established supercomputer firms forced 
          them into bankruptcy in 1993.</span></td>
