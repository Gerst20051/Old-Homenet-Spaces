          People with famous parents start life with a handicap. It becomes<br>
          a serious handicap if the parents are famous in a field in which the<br>
          child would like to make its own way.<br>
          Matthew Carter started with a very serious handicap, for his father,<br>
          Harry Carter, was both a great scholar in the world of type and printing,<br>
          and a type designer of extraordinary skill. His Cyrillic Baskerville, 
          for<br>
          example, will always be a model of grace and scholarship to anybody<br>
          who has tried to learn what should be known about cyrillic alphabets.<br>
          It is said that Harry Carter learned Dutch on the boat from Harwich to<br>
          Hook of Holland, and Hebrew making his way to Palestine in a variety<br>
          of planes and boats during the second World War. What is galling<br>
          to those of us whose grasp on other European languages is almost<br>
          cursory is that Matthew seems to have the same easy facility. What <br>
          is not galling to those of us who also have drawn typefaces for various<br>
          ‘imaging media’ (in the kind of vocabulary that finds its way onto the<br>
          web) is the breathtaking skill that he shows in making type that<br>
          works wherever it was meant to work.

          In its proportions and stroke weight, the Verdana <br>
          family resembles sans serifs such as Frutiger, and <br>
          Johnston’s typeface for the London Underground. <br>
          But to label Verdana a humanist face is to ignore the <br>
          successful fusion of form and function Carter has <br>
          achieved. This isn’t merely a revival of classical <br>
          elegance and savoir faire; this is type designed for <br>
          the medium of screen. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Verdana fonts are stripped of <br>
          features redundant when applied to the screen. They <br>
          exhibit new characteristics, derived from the pixel <br>
          rather than the pen, the brush or the chisel. The <br>
          balance between straight, curve and diagonal has <br>
          been meticulously tuned to ensure that the pixel <br>
          patterns at small sizes are pleasing, clear and <br>
          legible. Commonly confused characters, such as <br>
          the lowercasei j l, the upercase I J L and the number <br>
          1, have been carefully drawn for maximum <br>
          individuality – an important characteristic of fonts <br>
          designed for on-screen use. And the various weights <br>
          have been designed to create sufficient contrast from <br>
          one another ensuring, for example, that the bold font <br>
          is heavy enough even at sizes as small as 8 ppem. <br>
&nbsp; Another reason for the legibility of <br>
          these fonts on the screen is their generous width and <br>
          spacing. At low resolutions, because of the limited <br>
          number of pixels, letters cannot differ very much. <br>
          But often the smallest differences can often change <br>
          the whole look of a page, or a screenful of type; a fact <br>
          demonstrated in the illustration below

          Microsoft’s new Verdana typeface family consists of four TrueType fonts

          , and hand-hinted by leading hinting expert, Monotype’s <b CLASS="hl">&nbsp;Tom
