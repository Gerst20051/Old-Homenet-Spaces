<!-- INBODYEND --><a NAME="intro">Venus,</a> the <b>jewel of the sky</b>, was once 
know by ancient astronomers as the <b>morning star</b> and <b>evening star</b>. 
Early astronomers once thought Venus to be two separate bodies. Venus, which is 
named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, is veiled by thick swirling cloud 
cover.
<p>Astronomers refer to Venus as Earth&#39;s sister planet. Both are similar in size, 
mass, density and volume. Both formed about the same time and condensed out of the 
same <a HREF="terms.htm#nebula">nebula</a>. However, during the last few years scientists 
have found that the kinship ends here. Venus is very different from the Earth. It 
has no oceans and is surrounded by a heavy atmosphere composed mainly of carbon 
dioxide with virtually no water vapor. Its clouds are composed of
<a HREF="terms.htm#sulfuric">sulfuric acid</a> droplets. At the surface, the atmospheric 
pressure is 92 times that of the Earth&#39;s at sea-level. </p>
<p>Venus is scorched with a surface temperature of about 482° C (900° F). This high 
temperature is primarily due to a runaway <a HREF="terms.htm#greenhouse">greenhouse 
effect</a> caused by the heavy atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Sunlight passes through 
the atmosphere to heat the surface of the planet. Heat is radiated out, but is trapped 
by the dense atmosphere and not allowed to escape into space. This makes Venus hotter 
than <a HREF="mercury.htm">Mercury</a>. </p>
<p>A Venusian day is 243 Earth days and is longer than its year of 225 days. Oddly, 
Venus rotates from east to west. To an observer on Venus, the Sun would rise in 
the west and set in the east. </p>
<p>Until just recently, Venus&#39; dense cloud cover has prevented scientists from uncovering 
the geological nature of the surface. Developments in radar telescopes and radar 
imaging systems orbiting the planet have made it possible to see through the cloud 
deck to the surface below. Four of the most successful missions in revealing the 
Venusian surface are NASA&#39;s Pioneer Venus mission (1978), the Soviet Union&#39;s Venera 
15 and 16 missions (1983-1984), and NASA&#39;s Magellan radar mapping mission (1990-1994). 
As these spacecraft began mapping the planet a new picture of Venus emerged. </p>
<p>Venus&#39; surface is relatively young geologically speaking. It appears to have 
been completely resurfaced 300 to 500 million years ago. Scientists debate how and 
why this occurred. The Venusian topography consists of vast plains covered by lava 
flows and mountain or highland regions deformed by geological activity. Maxwell 
Montes in Ishtar Terra is the highest peak on Venus. The Aphrodite Terra highlands 
extend almost half way around the equator. Magellan images of highland regions above 
2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) are unusually bright, characteristic of moist soil. However, 
liquid water does not exist on the surface and cannot account for the bright highlands. 
One theory suggests that the bright material might be composed of metallic compounds. 
Studies have shown the material might be iron pyrite (also know as &quot;fools gold&quot;). 
It is unstable on the plains but would be stable in the highlands. The material 
could also be some type of exotic material which would give the same results but 
at lower concentrations. </p>
<p>Venus is scarred by numerous <a HREF="vencrate.htm">impact craters</a> distrubuted 
randomly over its surface. Small craters less that 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) are 
almost non-existent due to the heavy Venusian atmosphere. The exception occurs when 
large meteorites shatter just before impact, creating <a HREF="vencrate.htm#7">crater 
clusters</a>. Volcanoes and volcanic features are even more numerous. At least 85% 
of the Venusian surface is covered with volcanic rock. Hugh lava flows, extending 
for hundreds of kilometers, have flooded the lowlands creating vast plains. More 
than 100,000 small shield volcanoes dot the surface along with hundreds of large 
volcanos. Flows from volcanos have produced long sinuous channels extending for 
hundreds of kilometers, with one extending nearly 7,000 kilometers (4,300 miles).
</p>
<p>Giant <a HREF="terms.htm#caldera">calderas</a> more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) 
in diameter are found on Venus. Terrestrial calderas are usually only several kilometers 
in diameter. Several features unique to Venus include coronae and arachnoids. Coronae 
are large circular to oval features, encircled with cliffs and are hundreds of kilometers 
across. They are thought to be the surface expression of mantle upwelling. Archnoids 
are circular to elongated features similar to coronae. They may have been caused 
by molten rock seeping into surface fractures and producing systems of radiating 
dikes and fractures. </p>

the thick cloud coverage that prevents optical observation of the planet&#39;s surface. 
The surface of Venus remained hidden until 1978 when the Pioneer Venus 1 spacecraft 
arrived and went into orbit about the planet on December 4th. The spacecraft used 
radar to map planet&#39;s surface, revealing a new Venus. Later in August of 1990 the 
Magellan spacecraft arrived at Venus and began its extensive planetary mapping mission. 
This mission produced radar images up to 300 meters per pixel in resolution. The

This is a Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet-light image of the planet Venus, taken 
on January 24, 1995, when Venus was at a distance of 113.6 million kilometers from 
Earth. At ultraviolet wavelengths cloud patterns become distinctive. In particular, 
a horizontal &quot;Y&quot; shaped cloud feature is visible near the equator. The polar regions 
are bright, possibly showing a haze of small particles overlying the main clouds. 
The dark regions show the location of enhanced sulfur dioxide near the cloud tops. 
From previous missions, astronomers know that such features travel east to west 
along with the Venus&#39; prevailing winds, to make a complete circuit around the planet 
in four days. <i>(Credit: L. Esposito, University of Colorado, Boulder, and NASA)</i>

view of the surface of Venus. The viewpoint is located 1,100 kilometers (682 miles) 
northeast of Gula Mons at an elevation of 7.5 kilometers (4.6 miles). Lava flows 
extend for hundreds of kilometers across the fractured plains shown in the foreground, 
to the base of Gula Mons. This view faces the southwest with Gula Mons appearing 
at the left just below the horizon. Sif Mons appears to the right of Gula Mons. 
The distance between Sif Mons and Gula Mons is approximately 730 kilometers (453 
miles). <i>(Courtesy NASA/JPL)</i> <br CLEAR="ALL">

The southern scarp and basin province of western Ishtar Terra are portrayed in this 
three dimensional perspective view. Western Ishtar Terra is about the size of Australia 
and is a major focus of <a HREF="magellan.htm">Magellan</a> investigations. The 
highland terrain is centered on a 2.5 km to 4 km high (1.5 mi to 2.5 mi high) plateau 
called Lakshmi <a HREF="terms.htm#planum">Planum</a> which can be seen in the distance 
at the right. Here the surface of the plateau drops precipitously into the bounding 
lowlands, with steep slopes that exceed 5% over 50 km (30 mi). <i>(Courtesy NASA/JPL)</i>

<a href="../cap/venus/alpha1.htm" class="ct">Three-Dimensional Perspective View 
of Alpha Regio</a> <br>
A portion of Alpha Regio is displayed in this three-dimensional perspective view 
of the surface of Venus. Alpha Regio, a topographic upland approximately 1300 kilometers 
across, is centered on 25 degrees south latitude, 4 degrees east longitude. In 1963, 
Alpha Regio was the first feature on Venus to be identified from earth-based radar. 
The radar-bright area of Alpha Regio is characterized by multiple sets of intersecting 
trends of structural features such as ridges, troughs, and flat-floored fault valleys 
that, together, form a polygonal outline. Directly south of the complex ridged terrain 
is a large ovoid-shaped feature named Eve. The radar-bright spot located centrally 
within Eve marks the location of the prime meridian of Venus. <i>(Courtesy NASA/JPL)</i>

<a href="../cap/venus/arach1.htm" class="ct">Arachnoids</a> <br>
Arachnoids are one of the more remarkable features found on Venus. They are seen 
on radar-dark plains in this Magellan image mosaic of the Fortuna region. As the 
name suggests, arachnoids are circular to ovoid features with concentric rings and 
a complex network of fractures extending outward. The arachnoids range in size from 
approximately 50 kilometers (29.9 miles) to 230 kilometers (137.7 miles) in diameter. 
Arachnoids are similar in form but generally smaller than coronae (circular volcanic 
structures surrounded by a set of ridges and grooves as well as radial lines). One 
theory concerning their origin is that they are a precursor to coronae formation. 
The radar-bright lines extending for many kilometers might have resulted from an 
upwelling of magma from the interior of the planet which pushed up the surface to 
form &quot;cracks.&quot; Radar-bright lava flows are present in the 1st and 3rd image, also 
indicative of volcanic activity in this area. Some of the fractures cut across these 
flows, indicating that the flows occurred before the fractures appeared. Such relations 
between different structures provide good evidence for relative age dating of events.

<a href="../cap/venus/xcut.htm" class="ct">Parallel Lines</a> <br>
Two groups of parallel features that intersect almost at right angles are visible. 
The regularity of this terrain caused scientists to nickname it <i>graph paper</i> 
terrain. The fainter lineations are spaced at intervals of about 1 kilometer (.6 
miles) and extend beyond the boundaries of the image. The brighter, more dominant 
lineations are less regular and often appear to begin and end where they intersect 
the fainter lineations. It is not yet clear whether the two sets of lineations represent 
faults or fractures, but in areas outside the image, the bright lineations are associated 
with pit craters and other volcanic features. <i>(Courtesy Calvin J. Hamilton)</i>

and 10</a> <br>
The Soviet Venera 9 and 10 spacecraft were launched on 8 and 14 June 1975, respectively, 
to do the unprecedented: place landers on the surface of Venus and return images. 
The Venera 9 Lander (top) touched down on the surface of Venus on October 22, 1975 
at 5:13 UT, about 32° S, 291° E with the sun near zenith. It operated for 53 minutes, 
allowing return of a single image. Venera 9 landed on a slope inclined by about 
30 degrees to the horizontal. The white object at the bottom of the image is part 
of the lander. The distortion is caused by the Venera imaging system. Angular and 
partly weathered rocks, about 30 to 40 cm across, dominate the landscape, many partly 
buried in soil. The horizon is visible in the upper left and right corners.
<p>The Venera 10 Lander (bottom) touched down on the surface of Venus on October 
25, 1975 at 5:17 UT, about 16° N, 291° E. The Lander was inclined about 8 degrees. 
It returned this image during the 65 minutes of operation on the surface. The sun 
was near zenith during this time, and the lighting was similar to that on Earth 
on an overcast summer day. The objects at the bottom of the image are parts of the 
spacecraft. The image shows flat slabs of rock, partly covered by fine-grained material, 
not unlike a volcanic area on Earth. The large slab in the foreground extends over 
2 meters across. <br CLEAR="ALL">

13</a> <br>
On March 1, 1982 the Venera 13 lander touched down on the Venusian surface at 7.5° 
S, 303° E, east of Phoebe Regio. It was the first Venera mission to include a color 
TV camera. Venera 13 survived on the surface for 2 hours, 7 minutes, long enough 
to obtain 14 images. This color panorama was produced using dark blue, green and 
red filters and has a resolution of 4 to 5 min. Part of the spacecraft is seen at 
the bottom of the image. Flat rock slabs and soil are visible. The true color is 
difficult to judge because the Venerian atmosphere filters out blue light. The surface 
composition is similar to terrestrial basalt. On the ground in the foreground is 
a camera lens cover. This image is the left half of the Venera 13 photo. </p>
