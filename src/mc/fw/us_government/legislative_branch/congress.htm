        Articles of Confederation</a> (1781). It consists of the Senate and the 
        House of Representatives. Representation in the Senate is fixed at two senators 
        per state. Until passage of the 17th Amendment (1913), senators were appointed 
        by the state legislatures; since then they have been elected directly. In 
        the House, representation is proportional to each state&#39;s population; total 
        membership is restricted (since 1912) to 435 members (the total rose temporarily 
        to 437 following the admission of Hawaii and Alaska as states in 1959). 
        Congressional business is processed by committees: bills are debated in 
        committees in both houses, and reconciliation of the two resulting versions 
        takes place in a conference committee. A presidential veto can be overridden 
        by a two-thirds majority in each house. Congress&#39;s constitutional powers 
        include the setting and collecting of taxes, borrowing money on credit, 
        regulating commerce, coining money, declaring war, raising and supporting 
        armies, and making all laws necessary for the execution of its powers. All 
        finance-related legislation must originate in the House; powers exclusive 
        to the Senate include approval of presidential nominations, ratification 
        of treaties, and adjudication of impeachments. <i>See also</i>

  <span class="hw">Congress of the United States,</span> the legislative branch 
  of the federal government, instituted (1789) by Article 1 of the
  <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/united-states-constitution" target="_top">
  Constitution of the United States</a>, which prescribes its membership and defines 
  its powers. Congress is composed of two houses—the Senate and the House of Representatives.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">The Senate</span></b></p>
  <p>The senators, two from each state, have six-year terms and were chosen by the 
  state legislatures until 1913, when the Seventeenth Amendment, providing for their 
  direct popular election, went into effect. Actually, many states, especially in 
  the West, had already in effect adopted this reform through the use of the direct
  <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/primary" target="_top">
  primary</a>. The terms of one third of the senators expire every two years. A 
  senator must be at least 30 years old, a U.S. citizen of not less than nine years 
  standing, and a resident of the state in which he or she is elected. The Senate 
  is presided over by the vice president of the United States, who has no part in 
  its deliberations and may vote only in case of a tie; in his absence his duties 
  are assumed by a president pro tempore, elected by the Senate.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">The House of Representatives</span></b></p>
  <p>Members of the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states according 
  to their populations in the federal census. Every state is entitled to at least 
  one representative. States that are entitled only to one (currently Alaska, Delaware, 
  Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming) have a representative 
  at large, i.e., one elected by the whole state. The legislatures of those states 
  entitled to more than one representative have been required since 1842 to divide 
  their states into congressional districts. Representatives are chosen for two-year 
  terms, and the entire body comes up for reelection every two years. A representative 
  must be 25 or older, a U.S. citizen of at least seven years standing, and a resident 
  of the state in which he or she is elected. Although without a vote (except on 
  the committees on which they serve), one resident commissioner from Puerto Rico 
  (elected for a four-year term) and one delegate each from the District of Columbia, 
  American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (elected for two-year terms) 
  sit in the House. The presiding officer of the House, the speaker, is elected 
  by the members of the House and may designate any member of the House to act in 
  his absence. In 1910 a revolt against the powerful speaker, Joseph Gurney
  <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/joseph-gurney-cannon" target="_top">
  Cannon</a>, resulted in the transfer of much of the power and influence of that 
  office to the House
  <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/committee" target="_top">
  committees</a>. The reforms of the mid-1970s, however, modified seniority rules 
  and gave committee members and the speaker more powers, and changes introduced 
  in the mid-1990s by the Republicans further reduced the influence of seniority 
  and concentrated more power in the speaker and other members of the majority leadership.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">Responsibilities of Congress</span></b></p>
  <p>The most important responsibility of Congress is that of making the laws of 
  the United States. In both houses the work of preparing and considering legislation 
  is done by standing committees, and in addition there are special committees in 
  each house as well as joint committees with bicameral membership. The two houses 
  have an equal voice in legislation, but revenue bills must originate in the House 
  of Representatives. Bills, after having been passed by each house separately, 
  must be signed by the president of the United States within 10 days of their submission, 
  or they become law automatically, unless Congress is not in session. If vetoed 
  by the president, a bill may become law only by its repassage by a two-thirds 
  majority in each house. The Constitution requires a regular annual meeting of 
  Congress, which, since the passage of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, begins 
  on Jan. 3 each year. The president may call an extra session of Congress or of 
  either house. The proceedings of each house are recorded in the <i>Congressional 
  Record.</i></p>
  <p>Only the House of Representatives may impeach the president or other federal 
  officers and the Senate alone has the authority to try
  <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/impeachment" target="_top">
  impeachments</a>, but each house is the judge of the qualifications of its own 
  members. The Senate must ratify all treaties by a two-thirds vote and confirm 
  important presidential appointments to office, including cabinet members, judges 
  of federal courts, and high-ranking officers of the armed forces. Because of this 
  and because it is the smaller body and its members enjoy longer terms of office 
  and virtually unlimited debate, the Senate is regarded as the more powerful of 
  the two houses.</p>
  <p>Congress, as a whole, reached the zenith of its power during
  <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/reconstruction" target="_top">
  Reconstruction</a>. Throughout its history many critics have charged that Congress 
  operates under antiquated machinery and processes that are inadequate. Procedural 
  reforms proposed have included the adoption of a rule of relevancy in Senate debate, 
  employing joint hearings on similar bills, liberalizing the methods by which a 
  bill may be discharged from committee for consideration, and abolishing seniority 
  as the basis for committee chairmanships.</p>

        <p><i>The legislative branch of the U.S. government, consisting of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives. </i></p>
        <p>The Congress of the United States is the highest lawmaking body in the 
        United States and one of the oldest national legislatures in the world. 
        Established under the terms of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, the House 
        of Representatives and the Senate have for over two hundred years created 
        the federal laws governing the United States. Congress remains one of the 
        few national assemblies that research and draft their own legislation rather 
        than simply voting on bills created by the government in power. In addition 
        to its legislative functions, the U.S. Congress is empowered by the Constitution 
        to ensure that the administration of government is carried out according 
        to the laws it establishes, to conduct special investigations, and to exercise 
        other special powers in relation to the executive and the judiciary.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">History and Structure</span></b></p>
        <p>Between 1774 and 1789, the Continental Congress served as the federal 
        lawmaking body for the thirteen American colonies and (after it passed the 
        Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776) the United States. The Continental 
        Congress proved to be an ineffective national legislature, however, particularly 
        after
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ratification" target="_top">
        ratification</a> of its founding constitution, the Articles of Confederation, 
        in 1781. This congress lacked the authority to raise funds from the states 
        and was not adept at the administration of federal government.</p>
        <p>The Framers of the Constitution, meeting in the Constitutional Convention 
        of 1787, attempted to repair the shortcomings of the Continental Congress 
        by creating a more effective federal legislature. The resulting Congress, 
        made up of a House of Representatives and a Senate, first met with a quorum 
        of members on April 1, 1789, in New York City, eventually reaching its full 
        size at sixty-five representatives and twenty-six senators.</p>
        <p>Article I of the Constitution sets forth the basic form and powers of 
        Congress. As designed by the Constitution&#39;s Framers, the House is more responsive 
        to public sentiment, and the Senate is a more deliberate and stable body. 
        James Madison, writing in <i>The Federalist,</i> no. 62, argued that members 
        of the Senate should have a &quot;tenure of considerable duration&quot; and should 
        be fewer in number in order to avoid the &quot;intemperate and pernicious resolutions&quot; 
        often passed by &quot;single and numerous&quot; legislative assemblies. Accordingly, 
        the Constitution requires that senators serve six years in office, with 
        one-third of them up for reelection every two years—whereas all House members, 
        called representatives, go up for reelection every two years. In addition, 
        the Constitution requires that senators be at least thirty years old to 
        take office, whereas representatives must be a minimum of twenty-five years 
        old. Moreover, senators were originally elected by state legislatures and 
        representatives rather than the general population, but this procedure was 
        ended with the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913.</p>
        <p>Congress has grown steadily in size as the nation has gained population 
        and added states. The House reached its current size of 435 members in 1912, 
        and the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 (46 Stat. 21, 26, 27) fixed 
        its size at this number. The Senate reached one hundred members after the 
        admission of Hawaii as a state in 1959.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">Powers of Congress</span></b></p>
        <p>Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution defines the powers of Congress. 
        These include the powers to assess and collect taxes; to regulate commerce, 
        both interstate and with foreign nations; to coin money; to establish post 
        offices and post roads; to establish federal courts inferior to the Supreme 
        Court; to declare war; to establish rules for the government; and to raise 
        and maintain an army and navy.</p>
        <p>Article I, Section 8, also declares that &quot;Congress shall have Power … 
        To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution 
        the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in 
        the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.&quot; 
        Called the Necessary and Proper Clause or the Implied Powers Clause, this 
        part of the Constitution enables Congress to undertake activities not specifically 
        enumerated by the Constitution but implied by its provisions. The Necessary 
        and Proper Clause has been used to greatly expand congressional authority 
        (see <i>McCulloch v. Maryland,</i> 17 U.S. [4 Wheat.] 316, 4 L. Ed. 579 
        [1819]).</p>
        <p>Another power vested in Congress is the right to propose amendments to 
        the Constitution upon approval by two-thirds of both houses. Should two-thirds 
        of the state legislatures demand changes in the Constitution, Congress must 
        call a constitutional convention. Proposed amendments are valid as part 
        of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures or by conventions 
        of three-fourths of the states. Either means of ratification may be proposed 
        by Congress.</p>
        <p>Congress retains a number of other special powers. It may act as a judicial 
        body to
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/impeach" target="_top">
        impeach</a> and try a president or other civil officer for misconduct; in 
        such cases, the House impeaches, or charges, the official, and the Senate 
        conducts the trial. Congress is also empowered to create and use administrative 
        agencies and boards, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
        and the National Mediation Board, to determine facts and to enforce its 
        legislative policies and enactments.</p>
        <p>The Constitution vests each house of Congress with distinct powers as 
        well. The House, for example, has sole responsibility for originating all 
        tax bills, and the Senate has power to approve treaties. The House also 
        chooses the president and vice president if no candidate wins a majority 
        of electoral votes in the presidential election.</p>
        <p>Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution imposes prohibitions upon 
        Congress. This section forbids Congress to suspend the privilege of
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/habeas-corpus" target="_top">
        habeas corpus</a>, except in cases of rebellion; to pass ex post facto, 
        or retroactive, laws; to impose duties on exports; or to grant titles of 
        nobility.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">Apportionment</span></b></p>
        <p>Seats in the Senate are apportioned, or distributed, evenly across the 
        states, with each state receiving two. Seats in the House of Representatives 
        are apportioned between the states on the basis of population, with the 
        largest states receiving the most representatives and no state receiving 
        less than one. The Constitution requires that a

        will receive less than one member.</p>
        <p>The Constitution does not mandate that states having more than one representative

        a discriminatory or unreasonable basis.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">Investigations</span></b></p>
        <p>The Senate and the House of Representatives, acting together or independently, 
        can authorize investigations, or hearings, to obtain information for use 
        in connection with the exercise of their constitutional powers. Information 
        gathered in congressional hearings helps lawmakers draft legislation and 
        monitor the actions of government. It also informs the public about important 
        issues confronting the nation. Noted congressional investigations have included 
        the
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/teapot-dome-scandal" target="_top">
        Teapot Dome</a> inquiry in 1923, the 1973-74 Senate
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/watergate-scandal" target="_top">
        Watergate</a> hearings, and the
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/iran-contra-affair" target="_top">
        Iran-Contra</a> investigation in 1987. Congress has also examined perceived 
        threats to the government, as in the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954 in which 
        Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis.) led an investigation into Communist 
        influence in the U.S. government.</p>
        <p>A congressional committee may conduct an appropriate investigation under 
        the authority granted to it, but the methods used in the exercise of its 
        investigative power must not violate the constitutional rights of those 
        under investigation. The extent of the authority of a congressional committee 
        must be determined at the time the particular information is sought and 
        cannot be extended by later action of Congress.</p>
        <p>Congressional investigations can be held to obtain information in connection 
        with Congress&#39;s power to legislate and to appropriate funds, in addition 
        to other express powers it possesses. Congress has wide discretion to determine 
        the subject matter it studies as well as the scope and extent of its inquiry. 
        An investigation must, however, be based on direct statements made to Congress, 
        its members, or its committees. Congress or its committees may not indiscriminately 
        examine private citizens in order to learn valuable information or to inhibit 
        the exercise of constitutionally protected rights, such as freedom of speech.</p>
        <p>Individuals summoned in a proper manner, or subpoenaed, by Congress or 
        a committee must comply and conform with the summoner&#39;s procedure. However,
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/witnesses-1" target="_top">
        witnesses</a> are legally entitled to refuse to answer questions that are 
        beyond the power of the investigating body or that are irrelevant to the 
        matter under inquiry. A witness who has not been given a grant of
        <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/immunity" target="_top">
        immunity</a> can refuse to answer questions that tend to be incriminating 
        under the protection afforded by the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth 
        Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
        <p align="center"><b><span class="shw">Committees and Staff</span></b></p>
        <p>The work of preparing and considering legislation is done largely by 
        committees of both houses of Congress. The membership of the standing committees 
        of each house is chosen by the political parties in Congress. Committee 
        seats are generally distributed to members of different political parties 
        in a ratio equivalent to party membership in the larger House or Senate. 
        Thus, if a party has two-thirds of the seats in the House, it will have 
        approximately two-thirds of the seats in each House committee.</p>
        <p>Each bill and resolution is usually referred to the appropriate committee, 
        which may report it out (send it to the floor of the House or Senate) in 
        its original form, favorably or unfavorably; recommend amendments; or allow 
        it to die in committee without action.</p>
        <p>A growing workload and the increasingly complex nature of the legislation 
        it passes have caused Congress to hire an increasing number of staff. Over 
        eleven thousand staff served the 103d Congress, in 1993-95.</p>

    Speaker. The Speaker&#39;s powers as presiding officer are extensive; he or she 
    controls the course of

    debate</a> and enforces the rules of the House. Normally, the Speaker does not 
    personally preside over debates; instead, the task is delegated to other members. 
    The Speaker is also the head of his/her party (which has always been the majority 
    party) in the House, outranking the

    Article I, Section 6, Clause 2</a> of the U.S. Constitution prohibits members 
    of Congress from also holding a federal civil office, thus differentiating the 
    U.S. from
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/parliamentary-system" target="_top">
    parliamentary systems</a> where cabinet members are drawn from and continue 
    to sit in the legislature. The same section also prohibits members from being 
    appointed to offices created, or granted increased salary, during their term. 
    This is intended to prevent the creation of
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/sinecure" target="_top">

    eighteenth century</a>, some members of Congress did also serve as state legislators 
    and other state officials. Such cross-federal dual office holding is now prohibited 
    by state constitutions or statutes, or by general custom. It also does not explicitly 
    prohibit a particular person from serving in both the House and Senate at the 
    same time or, for that matter, from simultaneously holding two or more seats 
    in the House of Representatives. However, no person has ever done so; a member 
    holding a seat in one house has always resigned that seat before being seated 
    in the other house.</p>

    <h2>Powers</h2>
    <p>Section 8 of
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/article-i-of-the-u-s-constitution" target="_top">
    Article One of the United States Constitution</a> sets forth the powers of Congress. 
    The most important powers are the powers to levy and collect taxes, borrow money, 
    regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the states, coin money, establish 
    post offices and post roads, issue patents and copyrights, fix standards of 
    weights and measures, establish courts inferior to the Supreme Court, raise 
    and maintain the armed forces, declare war, and &quot;make all laws which shall be 
    necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers&quot;.</p>
    <p>There are additional powers other parts of the Constitution grant. For instance, 
    Congress has the power to admit new states to the Union (<a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/article-four-of-the-united-states-constitution" target="_top">Article 
    Four</a>). Other powers have been granted, or confirmed, by
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/constitutional-amendment" target="_top">

    electoral majority, the Senate may elect the Vice President from the two candidates 
    with the highest numbers of electoral votes. Several of the members of the Constitutional 
    Convention expected that, while

    and proper clause</a>&quot; of the Constitution permits Congress to make &quot;all Laws 
    which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution&quot; its other powers 
    and the rest of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has interpreted the necessary 
    and proper clause broadly, which has permitted the Congress wide authority.</p>
    <p>One of the foremost non-legislative functions of the Congress is the power 
    to investigate and to oversee the executive branch. This power is usually delegated 
    to committees—standing committees, special committees, select committees, or 
    joint committees composed of members of both houses. Investigations are conducted 
    to gather information on the need for future legislation, to test the effectiveness 
    of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance 
    of members and officials of the other branches. Committees may hold hearings, 
    and, if necessary, compel individuals to testify by issuing

    <h2>Checks and balances</h2>
    <p>The constitution provides certain
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/separation-of-powers" target="_top">
    checks and balances</a> among the three branches of the federal government. 
    The influence of Congress on the presidency has varied from one period to another; 
    it depends largely on the leadership and the political influence of the President. 
    The authors of the Constitution expected the greater power to lie with Congress 
    and that is one reason they are described in Article One. Under the first half-dozen 
    Presidents, power seems to have been evenly divided between the President and 
    Congress, in part because early Presidents largely restricted their vetoes to 
    claims of unconstitutionality.</p>

    <p>The Constitution empowers the House of Representatives to
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/impeachment" target="_top">
    impeach</a> federal officials (both executive and judicial) for &quot;Treason, Bribery, 
    or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.&quot; The Senate is constitutionally empowered 
    to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach 
    an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. 
    A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the 
    Senate may stipulate that the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/defendant" target="_top">
    defendant</a> be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings 
    may not inflict more than this; however, the party may face criminal penalties 
    in a normal court of law. In the history of the United States, the House of 
    Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. 
    (Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial). Only two Presidents 
    of the United States have ever been impeached:

    judges</a>, and other high officers with the &quot;advice and consent&quot; of the Senate. 
    The Senate confirms most presidential nominees, but rejections are not uncommon. 
    Furthermore, treaties negotiated by the President must be ratified by a two-thirds 
    majority vote in the Senate to take effect. The House of Representatives has 
    no formal role in either the appointment of federal officials or the ratification 
    of treaties.</p>

    Twentieth Amendment</a>, congressional terms begin at noon on
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/january-3" target="_top">
    January 3</a> of every odd-numbered year. It is conventional to refer to each 
    Congress by the ordinal number of its term. Thus, the current Congress (whose 
    term lasts from 2005 to 2007) is known as the &quot;<a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/109th-united-states-congress" target="_top">109th

    the &quot;<a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/108th-united-states-congress" target="_top">108th 
    Congress</a>,&quot; and so forth.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of each new term, the entire House of Representatives and 
    one-third of the Senate (those who were chosen in the election the previous 
    November) are sworn in. The
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/oath" target="_top">
    oath</a> taken is provided by statute: &quot;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that 
    I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all 
    enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to 
    the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any

    mental reservation</a> or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully 
    discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me 
    God.&quot; The House of Representatives also elects a Speaker to preside over debates. 
    The President <i>pro tempore</i> of the Senate, by contrast, holds office continuously; 
    normally, a new President <i>pro tempore</i> is only elected if the previous 
    one retires, or if there is a change in the majority party.</p>
    <p>A term of Congress is divided into two &quot;sessions,&quot; one for each year; Congress 
    has occasionally also been called into an extra, (or special) session. (The 
    Constitution requires Congress to meet at least once each year.) A new session 
    commences on
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/january-3" target="_top">

    Twentieth Amendment</a>, Congress met from the first Monday in December to April 
    or May in the first session of their term (the &quot;long session&quot;); and from December 
    to
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/march-4-1" target="_top">
    March 4</a> in the second &quot;short session&quot;. (The new Congress would then meet 
    for some days, for the inauguration, swearing in new members, and organization.)</p>
    <p>The Constitution forbids either house from meeting any place outside the 
    Capitol, or from adjourning for more than three days, without the consent of 
    the other house. The provision was intended to prevent one house from thwarting 
    legislative business simply by refusing to meet. To avoid obtaining consent 
    during long recesses, the House or Senate may sometimes hold <i>
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/pro-forma" target="_top">
    pro forma</a></i> meetings, sometimes only minutes long, every three days. The

    <p>Joint Sessions of the United States Congress occur on special occasions that

    Thomas Jefferson</a> discontinued the original practice of delivering the speech 
    in person before both houses of Congress, deeming it too monarchical. Instead, 
    Jefferson and his successors sent a written message to Congress each year. In 
    1913, President
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/woodrow-wilson" target="_top">
    Woodrow Wilson</a> reestablished the practice of personally attending to deliver 
    the speech; few Presidents have deviated from this custom since.</p>
    <p>Joint Sessions and Joint Meetings are traditionally presided over by the 
    Speaker of the House. However, the Constitution requires the President of the 
    Senate to preside over the counting of electoral votes.</p>

    <h3>Bills and resolutions</h3>
    <p>A proposal may be introduced in Congress as a

    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/resolution-law" target="_top">
    simple resolution</a>. Most legislative proposals are introduced as bills, but 
    some are introduced as joint resolutions. There is little practical difference 
    between the two, except that joint resolutions may include preambles but bills 
    may not. Joint resolutions are the normal method used to propose a constitutional 
    amendment or to declare war. On the other hand, concurrent resolutions (passed 
    by both houses) and simple resolutions (passed by only one house) do not have 
    the force of
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/law" target="_top">

    legislation</a> and submit it to a member for introduction. Congressional lobbyists 
    are legally required to be registered in a central
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/database" target="_top">
    database</a>, and are employed by
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/political-organisation" target="_top">
    political organizations</a>,
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/corporation" target="_top">
    corporations</a>,
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/state-government-2" target="_top">
    state governments</a>, foreign governments, and numerous other groups. In 2005, 
    there are almost 35,000 registered Congressional lobbyists, representing a doubling 
    since 2000. Some of the most prominent lobbyists are ex-members of Congress, 
    others are family members of sitting members. As an example,
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/dennis-hastert" target="_top">
    Dennis Hastert</a>,

    Roy Blunt</a> all have immediate family members who are (or were) lobbyists.</p>
    <p>Bills (and other proposals) may be introduced by any member of either house. 
    However, the Constitution provides that: &quot;All bills for raising Revenue shall 
    originate in the House of Representatives.&quot; As a result, the Senate does not 
    have the power to initiate bills imposing
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/tax-1" target="_top">
    taxes</a>. Furthermore, the House of Representatives holds that the Senate does 
    not have the power to originate
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/appropriation-bill" target="_top">
    appropriation bills</a>, or bills authorizing the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cost" target="_top">
    expenditure</a> of
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/federal" target="_top">
    federal</a> funds. Historically, the Senate has disputed the interpretation 
    advocated by the House. However, whenever the Senate originates an appropriations 
    bill, the House simply refuses to consider it, thereby settling the dispute 
    in practice. Although it cannot originate
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/revenue" target="_top">
    revenue</a> and appropriation bills, the Senate retains the power to amend or 
    reject them.</p>
    <p>Each bill goes through several stages in each house. The first stage involves 
    consideration by a committee. Most legislation is considered by
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/standing-committee" target="_top">
    standing committees</a>, each of which has jurisdiction over a particular subject 
    matter, such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing 
    committees; the Senate has sixteen. In some cases, bills may be sent to
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/select-or-special-committee" target="_top">
    select committees</a> (which tend to have more narrow jurisdictions than standing 
    committees. Each standing and select committee is led by a
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/chairperson" target="_top">
    chair</a> (who belongs to the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/two-party-system" target="_top">
    majority party</a>) and a ranking member (who belongs to the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/two-party-system" target="_top">
    minority party</a>). Committees are permitted to hold
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/hearing-3" target="_top">
    hearings</a> and collect evidence when considering bills. They may also amend 
    the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. 
    After considering and debating a measure, the committee votes on whether it 
    wishes to report the measure to the full house.</p>
    <p>A decision not to report a bill amounts to a rejection of the proposal. Both 
    houses provide for procedures under which the committee can be bypassed or overruled, 
    but they are rarely used. If reported by the committee, the bill reaches the 
    floor of the full house. The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise 
    procedures used by the House of Representatives and the Senate differ. A final 
    vote on the bill follows.</p>
    <p>Central party discipline is not as strong in Congress as it is in
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/parliamentary-system" target="_top">
    parliamentary systems</a>, and in the Senate it is weaker than in the House. 
    However, the leadership does have certain powers to sway reluctant legistators 
    to vote with the party. Party leaders derive most of their powers from the ability 
    to fundraise, to control the flow of legislation, and to assign desirable positions; 
    a rebel Congressman may be threatened with a cutoff of funds for his/her campaign, 
    a reduction of
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/pork-barrel" target="_top">
    pork</a> for his/her district, thwarting of his/her pet legislation, and/or 
    denial of a future committee chairmanship.</p>
    <p>The party leadership may use the &quot;<a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/catch-and-release-congress" target="_top">catch 
    and release</a>&quot; strategy in order to ensure the passage of important legislation 
    with the support of reluctant members. The leaders &quot;catch&quot; a member, pressuring 
    him or her to vote in favor of the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/legislation" target="_top">
    legislation</a> even if it is unpopular in the member&#39;s
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/constituency" target="_top">
    constituency</a>. Then, if the bill has sufficient support to pass anyway, the 
    member may be &quot;released,&quot; that is, permitted to vote as he or she pleases. Hence, 
    members may avoid alienating influential
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/special-interest-group" target="_top">
    special interest groups</a>, while remaining loyal to the party.</p>
    <p>Once a bill is approved by one house, it is sent to the other, which may 
    pass, reject, or amend it. In order for the bill to become law, both houses 
    must agree to identical versions of the bill. If the second house amends the 
    bill, then the differences between the two versions must be reconciled in a
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/conference-committee" target="_top">
    conference committee</a>, an <i>ad hoc</i> committee that includes both senators 
    and representatives. In many cases, conference committees have introduced substantial 
    changes to bills and added unrequested spending, significantly departing from 
    both the House and Senate versions. President
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/ronald-reagan" target="_top">
    Ronald Reagan</a> once quipped, &quot;If an orange and an apple went into conference 
    consultations, it might come out a pear.&quot; If both houses agree to the version 
    reported by the conference committee, the bill passes; otherwise, it fails.</p>
    <p>After passage by both houses, a bill is submitted to the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/president-of-the-united-states-2" target="_top">
    President</a>. The President may choose to sign the bill, thereby making it 
    law. The President may also choose to
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/veto" target="_top">
    veto</a> the bill, returning it to Congress with his or her objections. In such 
    a case, the bill only becomes law if each house of Congress votes to override 
    the veto with a two-thirds majority. Finally, the President may choose to take 
    no action, neither signing nor vetoing the bill. In such a case, the Constitution 
    states that the bill automatically becomes law after ten days (excluding Sundays). 
    However, if Congress adjourns (ends a legislative session) during the ten day 
    period, then the bill does not become law. Thus, the President may veto legislation 
    passed at the end of a congressional session simply by ignoring it; the maneuver 
    is known as a
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/pocket-veto" target="_top">
    pocket veto</a>, and cannot be overridden by the adjourned Congress.</p>
    <p>Every Act of Congress or joint resolution begins with an
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/list-of-enacting-formulae" target="_top">
    enacting formula</a> or resolving formula stipulated by law. These are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Act of Congress:</b> &quot;Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
      of the United States of America in Congress assembled.&quot; </li>
      <li><b>Joint resolution:</b> &quot;Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives 
      of the United States of America in Congress assembled.&quot; </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Quorum and voting</h3>
    <p>The Constitution specifies that a majority of members constitutes a
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/quorum" target="_top">
    quorum</a> to do business in each house. The rules of each house provide that 
    a quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call demonstrates the contrary. 
    Representatives and senators rarely force the presence of a quorum by demanding 
    quorum calls; thus, in most cases, debates continue even if a majority is not 
    present.</p>
    <p>Both houses use voice voting to decide most matters; members shout out &quot;aye&quot; 
    or &quot;no,&quot; and the presiding officer announces the result. The Constitution, however, 
    requires a
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/recorded-vote" target="_top">
    recorded vote</a> on the demand of one-fifth of the members present. If the 
    result of the voice vote is unclear, or if the matter is controversial, a recorded 
    vote usually ensues. The Senate uses
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/roll-call" target="_top">
    roll call</a> votes; a clerk calls out the names of all the senators, each senator 
    stating &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;no&quot; when his or her name is announced. The House reserves 
    roll call votes for the most formal matters; normally, members vote by electronic 
    device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. In the Senate, the 
    Vice President may (if present) cast the tiebreaking vote.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Privileges</h2>
    <p>Under the Constitution, members of both houses enjoy the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/privilege" target="_top">
    privilege</a> of being free from
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/arrest" target="_top">
    arrest</a> in all cases, except for
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/treason" target="_top">
    treason</a>,
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/felony" target="_top">
    felony</a>, and
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/breach-of-the-peace" target="_top">
    breach of the peace</a>. This
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/immunity-legal" target="_top">
    immunity</a> applies to members &quot;during their Attendance at the Session of their 
    respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same.&quot; The term &quot;arrest&quot; 
    has been interpreted broadly, and includes any detention or delay in the course 
    of
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/police" target="_top">
    law enforcement</a>, including
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/summons" target="_top">
    court summons</a> and subpoenas. The rules of the House very strictly guard 
    this privilege; a member may not waive the privilege on his or her own, but 
    must seek the permission of the whole house to do so. Senate rules, on the other 
    hand, are less strict, and permit individual senators to waive the privilege 
    as they see fit.</p>
    <p>The Constitution also guarantees absolute freedom of debate in both houses, 
    providing, &quot;for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned 
    in any other Place.&quot; Hence, a member of Congress may not be sued for
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/slander-and-libel" target="_top">
    slander</a> because of remarks made in either house. However, each house has 
    its own rules restricting offensive speeches, and may punish members who transgress 
    them.</p>
    <p>Obstructing the work of Congress is a
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/crime-1" target="_top">
    crime</a> under
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/federal-law" target="_top">
    federal law</a>, and is known as
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/contempt-of-congress" target="_top">
    contempt of Congress</a>. Each house of Congress has the power to cite individuals 
    for contempt, but may not impose any punishment. Instead, after a house issues 
    a contempt citation, the judicial system pursues the matter like a normal criminal 
    case. If convicted in court, an individual found guilty of contempt of Congress 
    may be imprisoned for up to one year.</p>
    <p>Aside from benefits directly facilitating their legislative work, members 
    enjoy a number of other perks. As of 2005 rank and file Congressmen received 
    a salary of $158,100. Congressional leaders are paid even more. Members are 
    granted several free Capitol parking spaces and are exempt from
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/parking-violation-1" target="_top">
    parking tickets</a> through the use of special license plates. Members of Congress 
    enjoy such facilities as private gymnasiums, low cost barbers, and subsidized 
    dining areas. They are also able to substitute their signature for postage allowing 
    them to send large quantities of mail at a reduced cost (<a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/franking" target="_top">franking</a>).</p>
    <p>Another privilege is the use of the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/library-of-congress" target="_top">
    Library of Congress</a>. The Library&#39;s primary mission is to serve the Congress 
    and its staff. To do this, the
    <a class="ilnk" onclick="assignParam('navinfo','method|4'+getLinkTextForCookie(this));" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/congressional-research-service" target="_top">
    Congressional Research Service</a> provides detailed, up-to-date and non-partisan 
    research for Senators, Representatives, and their staff to help them carry out 
    their functions as national servants.</p>
