    <b>Impact of Digital Cameras On Rate of Growth of New Photographs</b><br>
    <br>
    80 billion new photographs are taken around the world every year. Photography 
    generally follows the trends of the overall economy, for example, in the mid-1990&#39;s 
    there was a slight slowdown in photography concurrently with the economic recession 
    experienced in many major world economies, particularly those in Asia. However, 
    it is expected that in the next five years there will be continuing growth in 
    the overall number of photographs as the enormous potential of China, India 
    and other developing regions is realized. At the present 25% of film sales occur 
    outside of North America, Western Europe and Japan. In June 2000 Kodak announced 
    that China was its second largest market after the United States. To give some 
    perspective to the growth potential for photography in China, film usage there 
    is currently less than one roll per capita as opposed to 3.6 rolls per capita 
    in the United States. Similarly, only 15% of Chinese households own cameras 
    as opposed to over 80 percent in the United States.<br>
    <br>
    A countervailing trend to the growth of silver halide film based photography 
    is the increasing popularity of digital photography. Very rapid growth is predicted 
    over the next five years for this method of taking pictures. In 1999, in the 
    United States almost 2 million digital cameras were sold, double the number 
    from the year before and representing about 12 percent of all cameras sold. 
    In a survey by NPD Intellect, more than 70% of consumers planning to buy a new 
    camera say they will choose a digital one. Kodak projects that digital photography 
    will account for forty-five percent of its revenue by 2005 from a current 17%.<br>
    <br>
    Photofinishing News and Lyra Research predict that there will be an 80 percent 
    growth in the number of digital cameras worldwide by the year 2002. There were 
    8.3 million digital cameras in use worldwide in 1999 according to this study. 
    (compared to 200 million conventional film cameras in the United States alone). 
    Salomon Smith Barney predicts that the growth of photographic exposures worldwide 
    will grow from 71.4 billion in 1997 to 96.8 billion by 2002. At the same time, 
    they expect digital camera exposures to grow 1500 percent. Many of these photographers 
    will use web photo services. For example, Photo Works already hosts over 100 
    million images on its web site and there are many more companies competing in 
    this same market. These companies indicate that at this time 60 to 80 percent 
    of the photographs on their web sites are scanned from silver halide film.<br>
    <br>
    Kodak predicts that the growth trend will predominate until at least 2004, at 
    which point traditional film will gradually decline in use as the digital camera 
    becomes ascendant.<br>
    <br>
    The Internet may actually be increasing demand at the present for traditional 
    photographs points out Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. eBay has 4 million items 
    for sale every day and the inventory turnover averages about 7 days. About 80 
    percent of these items are accompanied by a photograph. About one-half of one 
    percent of current U.S. photographs are pictures of merchandise offered for 
    sale on eBay.</font><br>

    <b>Conversion and Compression</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Photographs</b><br>
    <br>
    To assess the amount of data in terms of bits in a photograph, certain assumptions 
    must be made about the size of the film used and the technical way in which 
    the photograph is digitized and stored. Professional photographers generally 
    use physically larger film formats with more chemical grains on the film to 
    store information than do amateur photographers. Conversion of these professional 
    photographs to a digital medium, therefore, generates a much bigger computer 
    file. For example, high quality professional photographs may require 40 megabytes 
    or more of storage space.<br>
    <br>
    In the early 1990&#39;s Kodak introduced the PhotoCD format for the storage of photographs 
    on compact disks. Since then, the format has been widely used by consumers, 
    professional photographers and archivists. Kodak estimates that most photographs 
    can be converted to its PhotoCD format with little to no loss of image data 
    in 5 megabytes. Kodak&#39;s rule of thumb is that it can place 100 photographs on 
    one CD, which holds approximately 650 megabytes. For the sake of carrying out 
    our estimates of total photographic data, therefore, we use this same 5 megabyte 
    figure.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, actual digital storage of photographs might consume far less space 
    if any of the very popular compression schemes are used. For example, the JPEG 
    standard is commonly used to reduce photographic file sizes to one-tenth of 
    their original size. However, this is a &quot;lossy&quot; compression, i.e., one where 
    data is irrecoverably discarded in the compression.</font></p>
    <p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 5 megabyte conversion 
    factor used is also supported empirically by the extensive image digitizing 
    experience of the University of California, Berkeley Digital Library. The photographic 
    collection there is reported as containing 164,702 images which require 888 
    gigabytes of storage space, or just over 5 megabytes per photograph. (http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/admin/rpts/TestSuite/00q2.html)<br>
    <br>
    <b>Motion Pictures</b><br>
    <br>
    The conversion of motion pictures to digital media can result in very large 
    file sizes. It is estimated that each frame of film can be digitized in about 
    12 megabytes. However, to create the illusion of seamless motion, 24 images 
    are used per second of film. Thus, one second of film requires 288 megabytes 
    of digital storage, one minute requires 17.28 gigabytes, and one hour requires 
    1 terabyte. At this rate a feature length film of 100 minutes would fill about 
    400 typical DVD&#39;s. Fox Animation Studios, for example, reports that its animated 
    feature &quot;Anastasia&quot; is 1.49 terabytes in size. This particular film was digitally 
    inked and painted and only then transferred to film for theatrical distribution.<br>
    <br>
    In cases where film will be distributed or stored on digital media such as DVD&#39;s 
    some form of compression must be used to make the file sizes tractable. The 
    most common compression format now used for motion pictures is MPEG-2. Using 
    this format, a feature lenth film can be reduced to several gigabytes in size 
    and placed on a single DVD. This is a &quot;lossy&quot; compression format where data 
    that is present on the film is irrecoverably lost in the compression process.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>X-Rays</b><br>
    <br>
    The conversion of x-ray images to bits requires careful attention to the loss 
    of information because of the attendant risk of harm to patients. See, The Economist, 
    &quot;Why JPEG&#39;s Can Be Bad For Your Health&quot;, June 2000, citing a study published 
    in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in which researchers found 
    that using JPEG with a compression ration of 16:1, the error rate was 30% higher 
    than for uncompressed images. In fact, in the United States conversion of x-rays 
    to digital format is regulated by the U.S. Government for the protection of 
    the patients. FDA Regulation 510(k).<br>
    <br>

    12 bits per pixel, provides 4,096 shades of grey) (wavelet compression, lossless 
    mode, has FDA 510(k) approval) 150 dpi, 12 bit images recommended by American 
    College of Radiology for primary reads). (Source: Steve Gilheany, Archive Builders 
    )<br>
    <br>
    A team of radiologists from the University of Florida estimated the size of 
    a converted conventional radiograph as 10 megabytes assuming a matrix size of 
    2048 x 2580 pixels with a 16-bit sample of each pixel. This estimate assumes 
    there will be no compression. Honeyman, Huda, Frost, Palmer &amp; Staab, &quot;Picture 
    Archiving and Communications System Bandwidth and Storage Requirements&quot;, Journal 
    of Digital Imaging, Vol. 9, no. 2, May 1996.<br>
    <br>
    A slightly smaller estimate of the amount of storage required for a standard 
    chest x-ray comes from the University of Pittsburgh, Clinical Multimedia Lab, 
    which estimates the size for a radiograph (2K * 2K * 16 bits) as approximately 
    8 megabytes (uncompressed). Clunie, David A., Lossless Compression of Grayscale 
    Medical Images - Effectiveness of Traditional and State of the Art Approaches 
    (<a href="http://www2.ios.com/~dclunie/papers/spie_mi_2000_compression.pdf">Link 
    to this paper (PDF)</a>)<br>
    <br>
    This latter figure will be used because it does not assume compression and is 
    generally consistent with the assumptions made for converting traditional photographic 
    film to digital format. Furthermore, Dr. H.K. Huang, Radiologist at UC San Francisco, 
    estimates that &quot;a typical examination generates betwen 10 and 20 MBytes.&quot; Huang, 
    &quot;Teleradiology Technologies and Some Service Models&quot; Computerized Medical Imaging 
    and Graphics, Vol.20, No.2 (1996). Applying this assumption of 8 mb per x-ray 
    image results in a total amount of data stored on x-ray film of 16 petabytes.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Flow of New X-Rays</b><br>
    <br>
    There are three common uses of x-ray film: medical imaging, dental imaging and 
    non-destructive testing in manufacturing processes. The Silver Institute Reports 
    that the medical uses of x-ray film overwhelm the other categories, accounting 
    for 92% of the world&#39;s overall x-ray film usage.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Medical Imaging</b><br>
    <br>
    The administration of radiologic procedures in the United States and the developed 
    world are fairly well documented. The number of such procedures in the developing 
    world, however, are harder to come by. The United Nations Scientific Committee 
    on the Effects of Atomic Radiation found that no data at all could be found 
    for radiological procedures for half the world&#39;s population and that there is 
    only fragmentary data on examination rates for another quarter of the world&#39;s 
    population.</font><br>

    <br>
    The UN Committee observed that the developed nations of the world use x-rays 
    at a rate generally consistent with that of the United States, i.e., approximately 
    1000 procedures (including dental uses) for 1000 population. Therefore, on the 
    assumption that the developed world&#39;s population is 1.2 billion, then a rate 
    of x-ray procedures of slightly more than one per person per annum would yield 
    approximately 1.2 billion x-ray procedures per year in the developed world. 
    The population of the less developed world is 4.9 billion. If it is assumed 
    that there are another 0.5 billion x-ray procedures performed for this population, 
    a rate one-tenth that of the developed world, then the world total of annual 
    medical and dental x-ray procedures is 1.7 billion.<br>
    <br>
    According to Clinica Reports and Theta Reports, the world market for x-ray film 
    is approximately $3.5 billion per year with the United States market accounting 
    for around $1.4 billion of that total amount, a 40% share of the world market. 
    If the dollar share of the market is reflective of the share of procedures performed 
    than there are about 750 million x-ray procedures annually. On the other hand, 
    it is reasonable to assume that film is sold for less in dollar terms around 
    the world than in the United States. If it is assumed that the price of film 
    in other markets is 50% of that in the United States, then this would work out 
    to about 913 million x-ray procedures outside of the U.S., and around 1.2 billion 
    for the entire world.<br>
    <br>
    Another approach to verifying these estimates is to take into account the use 
    of silver for the production of x-ray film as estimated by the Silver Institute. 
    In 1998, 71.5 million troy ounces of silver were used for medical x-ray film 
    and that was sufficient to produce 387 million square meters, or 4.2 billion 
    square feet, of x-ray film. This implies that one ounce of silver is enough 
    to produce 5.4 square meters, or 58 square feet, of medical x-ray film. Theta 
    Consulting estimated U.S. consumption of 1.7 billion square feet of medical 
    x-ray film to perform 309 million procedures in 1998, indicating usage of an 
    average of 5.5 square feet of film per procedure. If the same amount of film 
    were used per procedure in the rest of the world, 450 million medical x-ray 
    procedures were performed there. This is consistent with a world wide x-ray 
    procedure total of 750 million.<br>
    <br>
    We have chosen to estimate the total number of world medical x-ray procedures 
    at 1 billion annually as a reasonable balance of the available statistics and 
    assumptions discussed.<br>
    <br>
    In order to determine the actual number of x-ray images taken some calculation 
    must be made based upon the average number of films taken per procedure (more 
    than one image may be captured on one film). In fact, the number of films used 
    per procedure varies considerably. If 2 films are shot for each x-ray procedure, 
    there are approximately 2 billion x-ray medical images taken worldwide every 
    year.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Other X-Ray Uses</b><br>
    <br>
    The other major uses for x-ray film are dental imaging and the non-destructive 
    testing of materials in manufacturing and fabrication processes. These uses 
    are approximately 8 percent of overall x-ray film usage in developed nations 
    according to the Silver Institute. Accordingly, based upon the finding of 2 
    billion x-rays for medical purposes, then industrial and dental uses would amount 
    to 160 million x-rays in the developed world for all purposes. The total world 
    use of x-ray film is therefore approximately 2.16 billion images annually.<br>

    <b>Copies</b><br>
    <br>
    As more photographs are digitized through inexpensive home scanners or are taken 
    on digital cameras in the first place, it is not yet clear how often paper copies 
    will be made. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether output from digital storage 
    will typically be on photographic paper, or by means of ink jet or thermal printers. 
    Current indications are that ink jet printing will be the most common process. 
    In the year 2000, it is estimated that United States consumers will print out 
    5.4 billion photographic pictures, mostly at home. By the year 2005, this will 
    quadruple to 26 billion. At the same time, traditional photoprocessing is expected 
    to grow only 20 percent to 41.2 billion prints. (Source May 8, 2000 Wall Street 
    Journal.)<br>
    <br>
    The most common use made by consumers of digital images so far has been sharing 
    them through e-mail. Similarly many new businesses are counting on the consumer&#39;s 
    desire to share digital photos by hosting them on web sites. In December 1999 
    there were over 25 million unique home visitors and 12 million work visitors 
    to the web sites of over one hundred companies providing photographic hosting 
    services.<br>
    <br>
    It is anticipated that the growing number of digital images owned by consumers 
    will have a dramatic impact on their need to consider making backup copies of 
    their personal disk drives. Traditionally, only a small percentage of home computer 
    data is original data that requires backup at all. This need will grow dramatically 
    if many photographs are stored digitally. The web hosting companies are counting 
    on consumers storing the data on their sites and ordering prints from time to 
    time. Currently, consumers are able to get free photo developing and unlimited 
    disk space from these companies.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Copies of Motion Pictures</b><br>
    <br>
    The Wolfman Report on the Photographic &amp; Imaging Industry in the United States 
    states that the average number of prints per original motion picture is 700. 
    The Silver Institute, however, reports that 6,000 release prints are made for 
    each feature movie. Interestingly, however, these copies are short-lived. 98 
    percent of all films for theatrical distribution made in the United States are 
    destroyed by FPC, Inc.of Mountain City, Tennessee. After the films are no longer 
    being shown in movie theaters, they are sent to FPC, which destroys10 million 
    pounds of film every year. The film is shredded and sent to FPC&#39;s parent company, 
    Kodak, where it is recycled and made into new film or fuel used in power plants.

      <br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li>&quot;The reduction in the number of competitors is clearly seen in the medical 
      X-ray film market. In 1995, there were five global players: Du Pont, 3M, Kodak, 
      Fuji and Agfa, sharing approximately 90% of the world market. In 1996, Du 
      Pont sold its X-ray film business to Sterling, which subsequently announced 
      the resale of the business to Agfa in January 1999. The imaging division of 
      3M was spun off into a new company, Imation, in 1996, and this was subsequently 
      purchased by Kodak in August 1998 for US$520 million. There are now only three 
      major players in the global market: Kodak, Agfa and Fuji, assuming that the 
      Agfa/Sterling deal is approved by the US FTC and the European Commission. 
      This obviously leads to dominant companies with market shares in excess of 
      40% in some major markets. Further consolidation of these groups, however, 
      would almost certainly run into legal difficulties.&quot; Medical Device Technology

      <li>&quot;Greater volumes of products and hence bargaining power are being concentrated 
      into the hands of a declining number of purchasers. The greater volume and 
      value involved with each negotiation mean that the market-share impact of 
      either winning or losing a contract will increase. This can lead to a decline 
      in prices, as witnessed following the merger of Columbia and HCA, which was 
      widely considered to have started the rapid decline of film prices in the 
      US market between 1996 and 1998. Prices fell by more than 20%, wiping approximately 
      US$150 million per annum off the value of the US X-ray film market.&quot; Id.

        Photo CD, a format for digitized photography introduced by Kodak in 1992, 
        has been widely adopted both by professional and amateur photographers. 
        Kodak reports that the typical photograph can be digitized in this format 
        in 5 megabytes without loss of picture quality. Utilizing this conversion 
        factor, then, the world&#39;s 82 billion photos store 410 petabytes of data 
        every year in photographs.<br>

        <br>
        Apart from still photography, film is also used to store moving pictures. 
        In the years from 1990 to 1995, UNESCO reports that there were 4,250 films 
        produced annually throughout the world. The Motion Picture Association of 
        America reports that for the year 1998, its members released 221 movies 
        (compared to 219 in 1997), while releases by all U.S. companies, including 
        independent film companies, rose from 461 in 1997 to 490 in 1998.<br>
        <br>
        It takes approximately 2 gigabytes to store an hour of motion picture images 
        in digital form using the MPEG-2 compression standard. If the images in 
        4500 full length movies were converted into bits, the world&#39;s annual original 
        cinematic production would, therefore, consume about 16 terabytes.<br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="origflowxrays">X-Ray Film</a></b><br>
        <br>
        The other major use for film is the storage of x-ray images for medical, 
        dental and industrial purposes. Approximately 2 billion radiographs are 
        taken around the world each year, including chest x-rays, mammograms, CT 
        scans, and so on. (Traditionally, 8% of x-ray film is used in dentistry 
        and industrial applications.) When x-ray films are converted to digital 
        format, it is important that there is no important clinical information 
        lost. The University of Pittsburgh Clinical Multimedia Laboratory suggests 
        that an average conversion of a chest x-ray to digital storage with lossless 
        compression will require 8 megabytes. To store all the world&#39;s x-rays to 
        a computer file of this size would, therefore, require 17 petabytes each 
        year.</font><br>

        The number of original photographs stored around the world is not a widely 
        reported topic. There are commercial firms that collect professional photographs 
        for resale and the largest of these report collections in the tens of millions. 
        For example, Getty Images reports holding 70 million images mostly on silver 
        halide film and its principal rival, Corbis Images, claims 65 million images.<br>
        <br>
        As for amateur photographs, in 1997 it was estimated that there were 150 
        billion photographs stored in the United States. This is approximately 8 
        to 10 years production of photographs as of that time. Assuming that similar 
        storage rates apply worldwide, it is likely that on the order of 750 billion 
        photographs now exist. Using the same PhotoCD estimate of 5 megabytes per 
        photo, there are 3.5 exabytes of original photographic data.<br>

        The number of motion pictures made around the world from 1895 to 1990 was 
        approximately 242,000. <i>The International Film Index, 1895-1990</i>, lists 
        entries of that many titles of films. (There is no guarantee that some of 
        these movies still exist, however.) The overall total is broken down into

        than theatrical release. &quot;Serials&quot; are films made primarily in the United 
        States between 1914-1936 and were made to be shown in weekly installments.<br>
        <br>
        As discussed in the precedng section, in the decade since 1990, there have 
        been around 4500 movies made each year, adding another 45,000 to the total 
        world stock of original motion pictures. Accordingly, a good estimate of

        The clinical and legal uses of medical x-rays continue for an indefinite 
        time and, therefore, prudent practice is to preserve x-rays and medical 
        records generally for as long as possible. The same principle applies to 
        dental x-rays. The only use of x-ray that may result in regular destruction 
        of the resulting images is industrial testing, but even there it is likely 
        that images are retained for a substantial period of time. Therefore, it 
        is believed that there is little systematic destruction of the flow of new 
        x-rays and virtually all of them are added to the stock. For the sake of 
        calculation, it is assumed that a full ten years of x-ray images will constitute 
        the stock. This is equivalent to approximately 21.6 billion images or 172.8 
        petabytes.<br>

        <br>
        There has been very little history of the large mass of photographs being 
        copied. Kodak estimates that only about 2 percent of photographs are ever 
        copied or modified in any way after they are originally developed. Of course, 
        some photographic images are widely distributed in newspapers and magazines. 
        But these represent a miniscule fraction even of the professional photographer&#39;s 
        work, itself a small minority of all photographs.<br>
        <br>
        One copy of 2 percent of the annual new photographs would be 1.6 billion 
        photographic copies. With PhotoCD compression, this would represent 8 petabytes 
        per year of photographic copies.<br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="copiesflowmp">Motion Pictures</a></b><br>
        <br>
        The Wolfman Report on the Photographic and Imaging Industry in the United 
        States states that the average number of prints per original motion picture 
        is 700. The Silver Institute, however, reports that 6000 release prints 
        are made for each feature movie. A figure of 1000 copies for motion pictures 
        will be used on the assumption that many of the world&#39;s motion pictures 
        have more limited releases than the typical Hollywood blockbuster. American 
        studios only account for 400 to 500 movies per year. 45,000 copies of motion 
        pictures per year at 4 gigabytes per copy is 18 petabytes of copies.<br>
        <br>
        <b><a name="copiesflowxrays">X-Rays</a></b><br>
        <br>
        The clinical requirements for medical x-rays demand that originals be used 
        in almost any situation. There is no siginificant use of copies of x-rays 
        at all.<br>

        <b><a name="copiesstockphoto">Photographs</a></b><br>
        <br>
        The stock of copies of photographs can be calculated by reference to the 
        assumptions made for the storage of the originals. Ten years of copies of 
        photographs would be 16 billion. If these were all digitized at the rate 
        of 5 megabytes per picture, there are 80 petabytes of photographic copies 
        on hand.<br>

        <b><a name="copiesstockmp">Motion Picture</a></b><br>
        <br>
        The copies on film of motion pictures made for distribution are short-lived. 
        Most of these copies are deliberately destroyed when the general theatrical 
        release of the movie is over. If even ten of these survive for the approximately 
        4,000 motion pictures made annually for the last twenty-five years, this 
        would be equivalent to about 1,000,000 copies. If each copy is equivalent 
        to 4 gigabytes of data, this stock of copies of motion picture film is 4 
        petabytes.<br>
