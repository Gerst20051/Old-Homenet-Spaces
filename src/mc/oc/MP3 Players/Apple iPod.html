          <p class="intro">Now that you can buy movies from the iTunes Store and 
          sync them to your iPod, the whole world is your theater. With a 30GB or 
          80GB iPod in hand, those movies fit comfortably next to TV shows, new 
          iPod games, podcasts, audiobooks, photo albums, and, of course, an entire 
          library of music — up to 20,000 songs, in fact. Now starting at $249, 
          iPod is a pocket-size prodigy.</p>

          <h3>Watch this space</h3>
          <p>How much can your pocket hold? That’s up to you and your iPod. It holds 
          up to 20,000 songs, up to 25,000 photos, and up to 100 hours of video 
          — or any combination of each.<sup>1</sup> So you can browse movies on 
          the iTunes Store, download the ones you want (<i>Pirates of the Caribbean: 
          The Curse of the Black Pearl,</i> perhaps?), then sync it to your iPod. 
          Same goes for TV episodes, new iPod games, 99¢ songs, best-selling audiobooks, 
          and an entire universe of free podcasts, including captivating tours to 
          zoos, museums, and French chateaus. Go ahead. Fill ’er up.</p>

          <h3>Suit yourself</h3>
          <p>From cases to car kits, customize your iPod with accessories made especially 
          for it. Pick up an iPod Universal Dock for more convenient syncing. Add 
          an iPod Hi-Fi for room-filling sound. Sync photos on the go with an iPod 
          Camera Connector. Attach a voice recorder to take audio notes. And if 
          you buy from the Apple Store online, you can even have your iPod engraved 
          with your name or a message.</p>

          <h3>Play all day</h3>
          <p>With all that music at your fingertips, you may never want to stop 
          listening. Lucky thing your iPod plays audio for up to 20 hours.<sup>2</sup> 
          Or, if you’d rather watch, you can feast your eyes on movies and TV shows 
          for up to six-and-a-half hours.<sup>3</sup></p>

          <h3>Pack light</h3>
          <p>It might be a miracle. Otherwise, it’s hard to explain exactly how 
          30GB of storage can fit into an iPod that’s over 30% thinner than the 
          previous fourth generation. Or how an 80GB iPod can be the same size as 
          the 60GB model before it. However it happened, it means you can carry 
          your entire music collection — plus a nice selection of video — absolutely 
          everywhere you go. And a 60% brighter, more vibrant display gives your 
          album art, photos, and video extra oomph.</p>
          <h3>Search and enjoy</h3>
          <p>Finding what you want to hear among 20,000 songs could be quite a chore 
          — unless you have an iPod. A new interface lets you search your iPod using 
          the patented Click Wheel. And if you’re a fan of live albums, classical 
          works, or anything that sounds best when it’s continuous, iPod supports 
          gapless playback that seamlessly transitions from one song to another.</p>
