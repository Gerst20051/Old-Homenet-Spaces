<!-- Nature of the Work Content -->
<p>How and when companies and organizations use technology are critical to remaining 
competitive. Computer and information systems managers play a vital role in the 
technological direction of their organizations. They do everything from constructing 
the business plan to overseeing network security to directing Internet operations.</p>
<p>Computer and information systems managers plan, coordinate, and direct research 
and facilitate the computer-related activities of firms. They help determine both 
technical and business goals in consultation with top management and make detailed 
plans for the accomplishment of these goals. For example, working with their staff, 
they may develop the overall concepts and requirements of a new product or service, 
or may identify how an organization’s computing capabilities can effectively aid 
project management.</p>
<p>Computer and information systems managers direct the work of systems analysts, 
computer programmers, support specialists, and other computer-related workers. These 
managers plan and coordinate activities such as installation and upgrading of hardware 
and software, programming and systems design, development of computer networks, 
and implementation of Internet and intranet sites. They are increasingly involved 
with the upkeep, maintenance, and security of networks. They analyze the computer 
and information needs of their organizations from an operational and strategic perspective 
and determine immediate and long-range personnel and equipment requirements. They 
assign and review the work of their subordinates and stay abreast of the latest 
technology to ensure the organization does not lag behind competitors.</p>
<p>The duties of computer and information systems managers vary with their specific 
titles. <i>Chief technology officers</i>, for example, evaluate the newest and most 
innovative technologies and determine how these can help their organizations. The 
chief technology officer, who often reports to the organization’s chief information 
officer, manages and plans technical standards and tends to the daily information 
technology issues of the firm. Because of the rapid pace of technological change, 
chief technology officers must constantly be on the lookout for developments that 
could benefit their organizations. They are responsible for demonstrating to a company 
how information technology can be used as a competitive tool that not only cuts 
costs, but also increases revenue and maintains or increases competitive advantage.</p>
<p><i>Management information systems</i> (<i>MIS) directors</i> manage information 
systems and computing resources for their organizations. They also may work under 
the chief information officer and plan and direct the work of subordinate information 
technology employees. These managers oversee a variety of user services such as 
an organization’s help desk, which employees can call with questions or problems. 
MIS directors also may make hardware and software upgrade recommendations based 
on their experience with an organization’s technology. Helping ensure the availability, 
continuity, and security of data and information technology services is the primary 
responsibility of these workers.</p>
<p><i>Project managers </i>develop requirements, budgets, and schedules for their 
firms’ information technology projects. They coordinate such projects from development 
through implementation, working with internal and external clients, vendors, consultants, 
and computer specialists. These managers are increasingly involved in projects that 
upgrade the information security of an organization.</p>
<p><i>LAN/WAN</i> (local area network/wide area network)<i> managers</i> provide 
a variety of services, from design to administration of the local area network, 
which connects staff within an organization. These managers direct the network and 
its computing environment, including hardware, systems software, applications software, 
and all other computer-related configurations.</p>
<p>Computer and information systems managers need strong communication skills. They 
coordinate the activities of their unit with those of other units or organizations. 
They confer with top executives; financial, production, marketing, and other managers; 
and contractors and equipment and materials suppliers.</p>

<!-- Working Conditions Content -->
<p>Computer and information systems managers spend most of their time in an office. 
Most work at least 40 hours a week and may have to work evenings and weekends to 
meet deadlines or solve unexpected problems. Some computer and information systems 
managers may experience considerable pressure in meeting technical goals within 
short timeframes or tight budgets. As networks continue to expand and more work 
is done remotely, computer and information systems managers have to communicate 
with and oversee offsite employees using modems, laptops, e-mail, and the Internet.</p>
<p>Like other workers who sit continuously in front of a keyboard, computer and 
information systems managers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and 
hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>

<!-- Training Content -->
<p>Advanced technical knowledge is essential for computer and information systems 
managers, who must understand and guide the work of their subordinates yet also 
explain the work in nontechnical terms to senior managers and potential customers. 
Therefore, many computer and information systems managers have experience in a computer 
occupation such as systems analyst; other managers may have worked as a computer 
support specialist, programmer, or other information technology professional.</p>
<p>A bachelor’s degree usually is required for management positions, although employers 
often prefer a graduate degree, especially an MBA with technology as a core component. 
This degree differs from a traditional MBA in that there is a heavy emphasis on 
information technology in addition to the standard business curriculum. This preparation 
is becoming important because more computer and information systems managers are 
making important technology decisions as well as business decisions for their organizations. 
Some universities specialize in offering degrees in management information systems, 
which blend technical core subjects with business, accounting, and communications 
courses. A few computer and information systems managers attain their positions 
with only an associate degree, but they must have sufficient experience and must 
have acquired additional skills on the job. To aid their professional advancement, 
though, many managers with an associate degree eventually earn a bachelor’s or master’s 
degree while working.</p>
<p>Computer and information systems managers need a broad range of skills. Employers 
want managers who have experience with the specific software or technology used 
on the job, as well as a background in either consulting or business management. 
The expansion of electronic commerce has elevated the importance of business insight; 
many computer and information systems managers are called on to make important business 
decisions. Managers need a keen understanding of people, management processes, and 
customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Computer and information systems managers must possess strong interpersonal, 
communication, and leadership skills because they are required to interact not only 
with their staff, but also with other people inside and outside their organizations. 
They also must possess team skills to work on group projects and other collaborative 
efforts. Computer and information systems managers increasingly interact with persons 
outside their organizations, reflecting their emerging role as vital parts of their 
firms’ executive teams.</p>
<p>Computer and information systems managers may advance to progressively higher 
leadership positions in their field. Some may become managers in nontechnical areas 
such as marketing, human resources, or sales. In high-technology firms, managers 
in nontechnical areas often must possess the same specialized knowledge as do managers 
in technical areas.</p>

<!-- Job Outlook Content -->
<p>Employment of computer and information systems managers is expected to grow faster 
than the average for all occupations through the year 2014. Technological advancements 
will boost the employment of computer-related workers; as a result, the demand for 
managers to direct these workers also will increase. In addition, job openings will 
result from the need to replace managers who retire or move into other occupations. 
Opportunities for obtaining a management position will be best for those with computer-related 
work experience; an MBA with technology as a core component, or a management information 
systems degree; and strong communication and administrative skills.</p>
<p>Despite the downturn in the technology sector in the early part of the decade, 
the outlook for computer and information systems managers remains strong. To remain 
competitive, firms will continue to install sophisticated computer networks and 
set up more complex Internet and intranet sites. Keeping a computer network running 
smoothly is essential to almost every organization. Firms will be more willing to 
hire managers who can accomplish that.</p>
<p>Similarly, the security of computer networks will continue to increase in importance 
as more business is conducted over the Internet. The security of the Nation’s entire 
electronic infrastructure has come under renewed scrutiny in light of recent threats. 
Organizations need to understand how their systems are vulnerable and how to protect 
their infrastructure and Internet sites from hackers, viruses, and other acts of 
cyber terrorism. The emergence of cyber security as a key issue facing most organizations 
should lead to strong growth for computer managers. Firms will increasingly hire 
cyber security experts to fill key leadership roles in their information technology 
departments because the integrity of their computing environments is of utmost concern. 
As a result, there will be a high demand for managers proficient in computer security 
issues.</p>
<p>With the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the capacity of the Internet 
to create new relationships with customers, the role of computer and information 
systems managers will continue to evolve. Persons in these jobs will become increasingly 
vital to their companies. The expansion of the wireless Internet will spur the need 
for computer and information systems managers with both business savvy and technical 
proficiency.</p>
<p>Opportunities for those who wish to become computer and information systems managers 
should be closely related to the growth of the occupations they supervise and the 
industries in which they are found. (See the statements on
