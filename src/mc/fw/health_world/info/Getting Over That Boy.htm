    <img src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/All%20About%20Life%20And%20Boys/sad.gif" width="20" height="20">Yes, 
    it&#39;s raining and raining hard here in brokenheartsville. The good news is that 
    although it&#39;s painful, I have some tips and tricks that will ease the hurt and 
    get you on the road to sunshine and recovery...let me know if you find a rainbow 
    at the other end!</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="dodgerblue">Sadly, this is a very familiar situation 
    and it sucks. You really really really really liked him. You loved him. And...doesn&#39;t 
    matter how it happened....suddenly you don&#39;t have him anymore. </font>
    </strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="dodgerblue">The first step to getting over him is to 
    look at how it happened:</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="blueviolet" size="7">HE DUMPED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font></strong><img src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/All%20About%20Life%20And%20Boys/mad.gif" width="20" height="20"></p>
    <p><font color="deeppink"><strong>So he&#39;s turned around and dumped you. Now 
    not only do you have that big, gaping, hollow pain in your stomach but you&#39;ve 
    also suffered the humiliation of dumpsville. Chances are, if he chucked you, 
    its because he doesn&#39;t want to be with you. If he&#39;s chucked you for another 
    girl he&#39;s a slimeball and not worth thinking about.</strong></font></p>

    DUMPED HIM!</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="deeppink">If you really love this boy then I&#39;m guessing 
    you dumped him because (a) he cheated on you or (b) there was some difference 
    in your two life paths or some disagreement that meant you can&#39;t be happy together. 
    Think about it. You dumped him because you knew it was best or because he&#39;s 
    done something unforgivable. Now look forward to the good things in your life 
    without him. On the other hand, if you realize you&#39;ve made a BIG mistake, then 
    it might be worth looking at the I WANT HIM BACK page on this website.</font></strong></p>

    <p><strong><font face="arial" color="magenta" size="6"><u><em>6 STEPS TO HEALING 
    THAT BROKEN HEART:</em></u></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#dda0dd" size="4">1) Have a good, long 
    cry. </font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="blueviolet" size="4"><em>Crying, although 
    it&#39;s upsetting, will actually make you feel better once you&#39;ve stopped. Find 
    a nice quiet place to cry your eyes out where you wont be disturbed. Although 
    might feel like you need your mates right now, at this point you need to be 
    alone with your thoughts and your tears for an hour or two or even a few days. 
    It varies from girl to girl.</em></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="plum" size="4">2) Friend&#39;s the word</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="blueviolet" size="4"><em>NOW you need your 
    friends. Or, if you feel you&#39;re not close enough to any of your friends, you 
    need your family. Tell them exactly what happened and how you&#39;re feeling. Have 
    a good bitching sesh with the girls about your ex-boy. You&#39;ll be 
    surprised at 
    how easily they manage to list his bad points.</em></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="plum" size="4">3) Throw Him Away</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="blueviolet" size="4"><em>At this point 
    you don&#39;t need any reminders of your boy, even if you parted agreeing to &#39;be 
    friends&#39;. I should warn you it&#39;s very difficult to be &#39;just friends&#39; with someone 
    who&#39;s broken your heart. Delete his number AND his text messages from your mobile 
    phone. Throw away his picture, or, if you can&#39;t bring yourself to do that, get 
    one of your friends to keep it at their house so you won&#39;t be tempted to go 
    and look at it. If you&#39;re REALLY cut up, tear up his picture into tiny bits 
    and throw them in the bin. You&#39;ll feel exhilarated, but that&#39;s not for the faint 
    hearted.</em></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="plum" size="4">4) Get Out There</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="blueviolet" size="4"><em>Getting over love 
    takes time, though the length of time varies from girl to girl. If you want 
    to get over him though, you need to stop moping and get out of the house. Don&#39;t 
    go looking for anyone new just yet though...even if you want him to eat his 
    heart out. Spite might relieve your anger temporarily but it won&#39;t do anything 
    for your healing process in the long run...if he gets jealous you&#39;ll think he 
    wants you back and start hankering after him again. Get out with your girlie 
    friends and go shopping/clubbing/partying. Have girlie sleepovers. Remind yourself 
    of the reasons why single life is good. List all the advantages. Concentrate 
    on having a good time. The more you get out, the less you think about him. The 
    less you think about him, the more you start to get over him.</em></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="plum" size="4">5) Revisit your love</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="arial" color="blueviolet" size="4"><em>Ok, if you&#39;ve 
    gone out enough and you&#39;re starting to feel normal-ish again, take a deep breath 
    and revisit your love. You have to prove to yourself that you&#39;re really over 
    him. If you&#39;ve been avoiding him, take the time to talk to him and look at him 
    again. Don&#39;t avoid going to the places that were special to the two of you. 
    Otherwise, you&#39;ll find yourself stumbling across these reminders, months later, 
    and suddenly bursting into tears. This is one of the hardest parts of the healing 
    processes, but it&#39;s well worth it in the end. If at this point, you&#39;re still 
    feeling really really really wistful and sad for him, repeat step 4 and carry 
    on doing this until you feel relatively normal again.</em></font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="plum" size="4">6) New love?</font></strong></p>
    <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="blueviolet" size="4"><em>Ok, this step 
    is optional. You may decide that single life without boys is the bomb and you&#39;re 
    having a whale of a time doing just whatever you want. You go girlfriend! Good 
    for you! But there&#39;s nothing wrong with flirting or getting a new boyfriend 
    now, if that&#39;s what you want. Just remember, you&#39;re special no matter if you 
    have a boy in your life or not, and whatever decision you make, its all up to 
    you!</em></font></strong></font></p>
