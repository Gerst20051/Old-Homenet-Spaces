            Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's 
            inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. At various times 
            throughout the day, people with narcolepsy experience fleeting urges 
            to sleep. If the urge becomes overwhelming, individuals will fall 
            asleep for periods lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. In 
            rare cases, some people may remain asleep for an hour or longer.&nbsp; In 
            addition to excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), three other major 
            symptoms frequently characterize narcolepsy: cataplexy, or the 
            sudden loss of voluntary muscle tone; vivid hallucinations during 
            sleep onset or upon awakening; and brief episodes of total paralysis 
            at the beginning or end of sleep.&nbsp; Narcolepsy is not definitively 
            diagnosed in most patients until 10 to 15 years after the first 
            symptoms appear. The cause of narcolepsy remains unknown.&nbsp; It is 
            likely that narcolepsy involves multiple factors interacting to 
            cause neurological dysfunction and sleep disturbances. </p>

              There is no cure for narcolepsy.&nbsp; In 1999, after successful 
              clinical trial results, the FDA approved a drug called modafinil 
              for the treatment of EDS. Two classes of antidepressant drugs have 
              proved effective in controlling cataplexy in many patients: 
              tricyclics (including imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, and 
              protriptyline) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
              (including fluoxetine and sertraline).&nbsp; Drug therapy should be 
              supplemented by behavioral strategies.&nbsp; For example, many people 
              with narcolepsy take short, regularly scheduled naps at times when 
              they tend to feel sleepiest.&nbsp; Improving the quality of nighttime 
              sleep can combat EDS and help relieve persistent feelings of 
              fatigue. Among the most important common-sense measures people 
              with narcolepsy can take to enhance sleep quality are actions such 
              as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and avoiding alcohol and 
              caffeine-containing beverages before bedtime.

                On July 17, 2002, the FDA approved Xyrem (sodium oxybate or 
                gamma hydroxybutyrate, also known as GHB) for treating people 
                with narcolepsy who experience episodes of cataplexy.&nbsp; Due to 
                safety concerns associated with the use of this drug, the 
                distribution of Xyrem is tightly restricted.

              currently available medications enables people with narcolepsy to 
              consistently maintain a fully normal state of alertness.&nbsp; But EDS 
              and cataplexy, the most disabling symptoms of the disorder, can be 
              controlled in most patients with drug treatment. Often the 
              treatment regimen is modified as symptoms change. Whatever the age 
              of onset, patients find that the symptoms tend to get worse over 
              the two to three decades after the first symptoms appear. Many 
              older patients find that some daytime symptoms decrease in 
              severity after age 60.
