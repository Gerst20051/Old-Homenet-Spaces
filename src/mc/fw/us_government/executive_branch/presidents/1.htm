<p>On April 30,1789, George Washington became the first president of the United 
States. &quot;As the first of everything, in our situation will serve to establish a 
Precedent,&quot; he wrote James Madison, &quot;it is devoutly wished on my part, that these 
precedents may be fixed on true principles.&quot;<br>
<br>
Born February 22, 1732 into a Virginia planter family, Washington pursued two interests: 
military arts and western expansion. At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands. In 
1754, he fought the first skirmishes of the French and Indian War. He escaped injury 
although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him.<br>
<br>
From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution, Washington managed his lands 
at Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He devoted himself 
to a busy life. Like his fellow planters, Washington felt exploited by British merchants 
and regulations. He moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions.<br>
<br>
When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, Washington 
was elected commander in chief of the Continental Army. He took his ill-trained 
troops and embarked upon a war that lasted six grueling years. Finally in 1781 - 
with the aid of French allies - he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.<br>
<br>
Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon. But the nation under 
its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well, so he became a prime mover 
in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. When 
the new Constitution was ratified, the Electoral College unanimously elected him 
president.<br>
<br>
He did not infringe upon the policy-making powers he felt the Constitution gave 
Congress. But the determination of foreign policy became a preponderantly presidential 
concern. When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England, 
Washington insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger.<br>
<br>
To his disappointment, two parties were developing by the end of his first term. 
Weary of politics, he retired at the end of his second. In his Farewell Address, 
he urged his countrymen to forswear any excessive party spirit and geographical 
distinctions. In foreign affairs, he warned against long-term alliances.<br>
<br>
Washington enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon, where he 
died of a throat infection on December 14, 1799.</p>
