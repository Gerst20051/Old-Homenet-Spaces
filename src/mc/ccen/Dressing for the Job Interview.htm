<h2 align="center">Dressing for the Job Interview</h2>
<p>Well, your resume worked and now you have an appointment for the all important 
job interview. You have done your homework. You are confident that you can answer 
anything the interviewer throws at you. Finally the big day arrives and the final 
important choice must be made. What should you wear? </p>
<p>It is no secret that how you look has everything to do with the first impression 
you make. A first impression is made in the first 27 seconds. If you are too formal 
in your appearance, you might give the impression of being rigid and stuffy. If 
you are too casual, you may send the signal that you do not take the interview or 
the job very seriously. </p>
<p>Begin by talking to employees of your potential new employer and find out what 
the dress code is and how seriously management takes it. If you can&#39;t find out this 
information, you should choose clothing that is professional in the impression it 
gives. </p>
<p>If you do not already own clothing that will work on an interview, you should 
go to a store where you can get good advice from the sales person. Be prepared to 
have the clothes tailored. No human being completely fits in clothes that are off 
the rack. To make the best impression the clothes must be altered to fit and accent 
your best features. </p>
The following ideas can never be neglected:<ul>
  <li>Look clean and neat. Make sure that your hair is done appropriately. Women 
  - do not wear wild hairdo&#39;s Men - get a trim of head and facial hair.</li>
  <li>Do not wear a perfume or cologne as many people are allergic. Bathing with 
  a good quality bath soap will leave a light scent. You will be nervous and a gentle 
  scent can mask the perspiring you may be doing. An unscented antiperspirant can 
  be used.</li>
  <li>Cover any tattoos and avoid gaudy jewelry. Definitely limit pierced jewelry 
  to ears only. Do not wear nose or tongue jewelry<!-- End Related Articles - in the article body (relatedarticlebox: 2984820) [86] -->.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>MEN</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wear a suit or sport jacket with color coordinated trousers.</li>
  <li>The color should be neutral or dark - blue, black or gray is best.</li>
  <li>Wear a tie - even if you will never wear one after you get the job.</li>
  <li>Shoes should be leather - clean and polished - black is best.</li>
  <li>Make sure your nails are trimmed and that they are clean.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WOMEN</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wear a classic suit or a simple dress with a jacket. This is not a time to 
  be provocative or sexy. Some appropriate colors are navy blue, black, dark green, 
  dark red, burgundy, or gray.</li>
  <li>Dress in a higher style that the position calls for but do not attempt to 
  out dress everyone there.</li>
  <li>Avoid wearing clothes that are tight, revealing or trendy. It may be the very 
  latest fashion but it will not impress the interviewer.</li>
  <li>Fingernails should be trimmed to a length that doesn&#39;t leave an observer wondering 
  how you keep from stabbing yourself. The polish should be closer to a color your 
  mom might wear that to a color that your kid sister would go for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after you are successful in getting the job, you should continue to pay 
attention to your wardrobe. Interviewing for that first job is only the beginning 
in the role clothing will play in your career.</p>
<p>You should regularly add pieces made of high quality, long wearing fabrics. It 
is best to buy separates that you can mix and match with the pieces that you already 
own. Each piece you buy adds to the variety of looks you can achieve. You may ask 
why this is important? The reason is that even after you have the job you sought, 
you might like to be considered for advancement and promotion. The impression you 
leave on the job every day will be added to your performance when the boss looks 
around for someone to promote.</p>
