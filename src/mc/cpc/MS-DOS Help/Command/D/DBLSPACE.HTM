      automatic mounting of removable drives, including
      floppy disk drives. By default, DoubleSpace
      automatically mounts all removable drives.</dd>

      <dd>The values for /AUTOMOUNT=char are:

          <li><b>0</b> Prevents DoubleSpace from automatically
          mounting removable drives. Use this value to save

      <dd>Compresses the files on an existing hard disk
      drive, floppy disk, or other removable media.
      Compressing an existing drive
      (<a href="#ParameterDrive">drive:</a>) makes more
      space available on that drive.</dd>
      <dd><b>Note:</b> DoubleSpace cannot compress a drive
      that's completely full. To compress your startup hard
      disk drive, the drive must contain at least 1.2 MB of
      free space. Other hard disk drives and floppy disks
      must contain at least 1.1 MB of free space.
      (DoubleSpace cannot compress 360K floppy disks.)</dd>
      <dd>You can use DoubleSpace to increase the storage
      capacity of floppy disks in addition to hard disks.
      After compressing a floppy disk, you can use it to
      store data or to transfer data from one computer to
      another.</dd>
      <dd>Compressing a floppy disk is similar to compressing
      an existing hard disk drive. You can compress a floppy
      disk that is completely empty or one that contains a
      few files. (Make sure the floppy disk is formatted and
      has at least 1.1 MB of free space. DoubleSpace cannot
      compress a floppy disk that is full. DoubleSpace also
      cannot compress 360K floppy disks.)</dd>
      <dd>In general, you use a compressed floppy disk just
      as you would a normal floppy disk. The main difference
      is that, to use a compressed floppy disk to transfer
      data from one computer to another, both computers must
      be running DoubleSpace.</dd>
      <dd>By default, DoubleSpace automatically mounts a
      compressed floppy disk when you try to use that disk.
      However, if you disable DoubleSpace's <a href="#SwitchAutomount">Automount</a> feature
      in order to save memory, you must mount each
      compressed floppy disk yourself, before you can use it.</dd>
      <dd>If you have turned off
      <a href="#SwitchAutomount">Automount</a>, when you first
      compress a floppy disk, DoubleSpace mounts it for you.
      However, if you change floppy disks or restart your
      computer, you will have to remount the floppy disk
      before you can use it again.</dd>
      <dd>To mount a floppy disk, use the
      <a href="#SwitchMount">/MOUNT</a> option.</dd>
      <dd>To enable or disable DoubleSpace's <a href="#SwitchAutomount">Automount</a>
      feature, use the <a href="#SwitchAutomount">/AUTOMOUNT</a>
      option.</dd>

      <dt><a name="SwitchCreate"></a> /CR[EATE]
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Creates a new compressed drive
      (<a href="#ParameterDrive">drive:</a>) by using
      free space on an existing uncompressed drive. The new
      compressed drive will provide more storage capacity
      than the amount of space it uses.</dd>

      <dt><a name="SwitchDefragment"></a> /DEF[RAGMENT]
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Defragments the selected compressed drive.
      Defragmenting a compressed drive consolidates the free
      space on it. If you are planning to reduce the size of
      a compressed drive, you should first use the
      Defragment command to consolidate the drive's free
      space. You can then make the drive smaller than you
      could if you did not first defragment it.</dd>
      <dd>The <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a> command
      optimizes disk performance by reorganizing the files
      on a drive. You can use <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a>
      to optimize uncompressed drives. Although you can run
      <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a> on a compressed
      drive, doing so will probably not improve your
      system's speed.</dd>
      <dd>Unlike the <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a>
      command, the /DEFRAGMENT switch does not speed up your
      system. /DEFRAGMENT simply consolidates a compressed
      drive's free space so that all the free space is at
      the end of the compressed volume file. This provides
      the fullest utilization of your disk space, and also
      enables you to reduce the size of the compressed drive
      more than you otherwise could.</dd>
      <dd>To defragment a compressed drive as much as
      possible, use both the <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a>
      command and the /DEFRAGMENT switch:
        <ol>
          <li>Defragment the drive by using the
          <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">DEFRAG</a> command.</li>
          <li>Defragment it again by using the DBLSPACE
          <a href="#SwitchDefragment">/DEFRAGMENT</a>
          <a href="#SwitchF">/F</a> command.</li>
          <li>Defragment it a third time by using the
          DBLSPACE <a href="#SwitchDefragment">/DEFRAGMENT</a>
          command without the <a href="#SwitchF">/F</a>
          switch.</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="SwitchDelete"></a> /DEL[ETE]
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Deletes the selected compressed drive
      (<a href="#ParameterDrive">drive:</a>) and erases the
      associated compressed volume file.</dd>
      <dd><b>CAUTION:</b> Deleting a compressed drive erases
      the entire drive and all the files it contains.</dd>
      <dd>If you accidentally delete a compressed drive, you
      might be able to restore it by using Microsoft
      <a href="../U/UNDELETE.HTM">Undelete</a>. When
      DoubleSpace deletes a compressed drive, it actually
      deletes a file on your uncompressed drive. This file
      is called the &quot;compressed volume file&quot;. A
      compressed volume file has a filename in the form
      DBLSPACE.nnn (ie. DBLSPACE.000).</dd>
      <dd>First, restore the deleted compressed volume file
      by using <a href="../U/UNDELETE.HTM">Undelete</a>.
      Once you have restored the file, remount it by using
      the DBLSPACE <a href="#SwitchMount">/MOUNT</a>
      command. If DoubleSpace cannot remount the compressed
      volume file, run <a href="../S/SCANDISK.HTM">ScanDisk</a>
      on that compressed volume file.</dd>

      <dt><a name="SwitchDoubleguard"></a> /DOUBLEGUARD=0|1

      <dd>Modifes the DOUBLEGUARD setting in the <a href="#DBLSPACEINI">DBLSPACE.INI</a>
      file. The DOUBLEGUARD setting enables or disables
      DoubleGuard(tm) safety checking. When DoubleGuard is
      enabled, DoubleSpace will constantly check its memory
      for damage by some other program. If it detects any
      memory damage, DoubleSpace will halt your computer to
      minimize damage to your data. By default, DoubleGuard
      is enabled.</dd>
      <dd><b>Note:</b> For this switch to take effect, you
      must restart your computer.</dd>
      <dd>The values for /DOUBLEGUARD=char are:
        <ul>
          <li><b>0</b> Prevents DoubleSpace from checking its
          memory for damage by other programs. Using this
          switch might speed up your system, but could
          result in loss of data if a program violates the
          memory DoubleSpace is using.</li>
          <li><b>1</b> Directs DoubleSpace to check its
          memory for damage by other programs. This is the
          default setting.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="SwitchF"></a> /F
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Prevents DoubleSpace from displaying the final
      screen when compression is complete. This screen
      includes compression statistics. If you specify the
      /F switch, DoubleSpace returns to the command prompt

      <dd>Formats the selected compressed drive.</dd>
      <dd><b>CAUTION:</b> Formatting a compressed drive

      a drive that has been formatted by using /FORMAT.</dd>

      <dt><a name="SwitchHost"></a> /HOST=drive:

      <dd>Modifes the LASTDRIVE setting in the <a href="#DBLSPACEINI">DBLSPACE.INI</a>
      file. The LASTDRIVE setting specifies the highest
      drive letter available to DoubleSpace. (If another
      program uses one of the drive letters specified for
      DoubleSpace, the highest drive letter available to
      DoubleSpace will be higher than that specified by

      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Modifes the MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES setting in the
      DBLSPACE.INI file. The MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES setting
      specifies how many additional drives DoubleSpace should
      allocate memory for when your computer starts. This
      determines how many additional compressed drives you
      can create, compress, or mount without restarting your
      computer.</dd>
      <dd><b>Note:</b> For this switch to take effect, you
      must restart your computer.</dd>
      <dd>The number of additional drives (n) for which

      <dt><a name="SwitchMount"></a> /MO[UNT]=nnn
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Establishes a connection between a compressed
      volume file (CVF) and a drive letter so that you can
      use the files the CVF contains. DoubleSpace usually
      mounts CVFs automatically. You need to mount a CVF
      only if you previously unmounted it, or if the CVF is
      located on a floppy disk and <a href="#SwitchAutomount">Automount</a> is disabled.</dd>
      <dd>Directs DoubleSpace to mount the compressed volume

      <dt> /NEW[DRIVE]=drive2:
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the drive letter for the uncompressed
      (host) drive. After DoubleSpace creates/compresses an existing
      drive, your system will include both the existing
      drive (now created/compressed) and a new uncompressed drive.
      if omitted, DoubleSpace assigns the next available
      drive letter to the new drive.</dd>
      <dd>Specifies the drive letter to assign to the new

      <dt><a name="SwitchRatio"></a> /RA[TIO][=n.n]
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Changes the estimated compression ratio of the
      selected drive. DoubleSpace uses this ratio to estimate
      how much free space the drive contains. You might want
      to change the estimated compression ratio if you plan
      to store new files with a compression ratio that
      differs greatly from the current ratio.</dd>
      <dd>To change the ratio to a specific number, specify
      the ratio you want. You can specify a ratio from 1.0
      to 16.0. If you don't specify a ratio, DoubleSpace sets
      the drive's estimated compression ratio to the average
      actual compression ratio for all the files currently
      on the drive.</dd>

      <dt> /RES[ERVE]=size
      (<a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">v6.0</a>)</dt>
      <dd>Specifies how many megabytes of free space to leave
      uncompressed. To make the compressed drive as large as
      possible, specify a size of 0.
      Because some files, such as the Windows
      swap file, do not work properly when stored on a
      compressed drive, it's a good idea to reserve some
      uncompressed space. The uncompressed space will be
      located on the new uncompressed drive. (If the drive
      you are compressing contains a Windows permanent swap
      file, DoubleSpace moves the file to the new

    <a name="What"></a> <b>What does DoubleSpace do?</b>
    <p>DoubleSpace is a disk-compression program. It stores
    more files in less space by storing those files more
    efficiently. Most files are stored fairly inefficiently
    -- somewhat like a sponge that has a lot of air holes in
    it. When you squeeze a sponge, it becomes temporarily
    smaller; but when you let go of it, the sponge returns
    to its original shape and size. When you compress a
    drive, DoubleSpace "squeezes" the files on that drive
    until they are as small as possible -- just like
    squeezing a sponge. A file stored on a compressed drive
    stays "squeezed" until you use it. When the file is
    loaded into memory, DoubleSpace uncompresses the file so
    that it returns to its original size, just as a sponge
    does when you let go of it. When you're finished using
    the file, DoubleSpace "squeezes" it again and stores it
    back on the compressed drive.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="When"></a> <b>When should I use DoubleSpace?</b>
    <p>You should use DoubleSpace if you are running low on
    disk space and don't want to invest in a larger hard
    disk drive. DoubleSpace can dramatically increase your
    available disk space. However, because DoubleSpace uses
    at least 33K of memory, it makes sense not to install
    DoubleSpace unless you need it.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="How"></a> <b>How does DoubleSpace "squeeze" a file?</b>
    <p>Most files contain a lot of repeated data. When
    DoubleSpace finds repeated data in a file, it retains the
    first occurrence of that data, and replaces any other
    occurrences of that data with a cross-reference to the
    first occurrence. The cross-reference takes less space
    than the original data.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="Why"></a> <b>Why does DoubleSpace compress some files more than others?</b>
    <p>Some files contain more repeated data than others.
    (Program files are usually compiled so that they are
    stored as efficiently as possible; program files are
    typically not as compressible as some other types of
    files. Bitmap files and text files typically compress
    well, since most such files contain a lot of repeated
    data. Files that were already compressed by using a
    standalone compression program (ARJ, RAR, ZIP) usually
    do not compress any further; although you can store such
    files on a compressed drive, there is little advantage
    to doing so.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="Slow"></a> <b>Will DoubleSpace slow down my system?</b>
    <p>If you have a computer with a fast CPU and a fast
    hard disk, you probably won't notice much difference in
    system speed after installing DoubleSpace. If you have a
    fast CPU and a slow hard disk, DoubleSpace might actually
    improve your system's speed. If your computer has a slow
    CPU, you may notice a reduction in speed after
    compressing your drive.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="Setup"></a> <b>What happens during DoubleSpace Setup?</b>
    <p>DoubleSpace Setup configures your computer to run
    DoubleSpace and compresses the drive of your choice.
    DoubleSpace Setup first runs <a href="../S/SCANDISK.HTM">ScanDisk</a>
    to check your hard disk for logical and physical errors.
    If necessary, it runs the Microsoft
    <a href="DEFRAG.HTM">Defragmenter</a> to defragment
    the files on your disk. Finally, it compresses the files
    on your drive. For more information about running
    DoubleSpace Setup, see "Freeing Space by Using DoubleSpace"
    in the MS-DOS User's Guide or the MS-DOS User's Guide
    Addendum.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="AdditionalDrive"></a> <b>Now that I've installed DoubleSpace, why do I have an additional drive?</b>
    <p>When DoubleSpace Setup is complete, you will have an
    additional drive.</p>

    <p>If you chose to create a new compressed drive, the
    additional drive is the compressed drive you just
    created.</p>

    <p>If you compressed an existing drive the additional
    drive is an uncompressed drive. It is used to store
    files that must remain uncompressed (such as the Windows
    swap file). The additional drive also contains important
    system files such as:
    <ul>
      <li>IO.SYS</li>
      <li>MSDOS.SYS</li>
      <li>DBLSPACE.BIN</li>
      <li><a href="#DBLSPACEINI">DBLSPACE.INI</a></li>
      <li>DBLSPACE.000</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>CAUTION:</b> Do not delete or otherwise tamper
    with the hidden files on the new drive. If you do, you
    might lose your compressed drive and all the files it
    contains.</p>

    <p>For more information about DoubleSpace Setup, see the
    "Understanding Disk Compression" section of "Freeing
    Space by Using DoubleSpace" in the MS-DOS User's Guide or
    the MS-DOS User's Guide Addendum,</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="CopyUncompressed"></a> <b>Can I copy a file from a compressed drive to an uncompressed drive?</b>
    <p>Yes. You can copy files between compressed drives and
    uncompressed drives just as you would between two
    uncompressed drives. A file is actually compressed only
    when it is stored on a compressed drive. When you copy a
    file from your compressed drive, DoubleSpace reads the
    file into memory and uncompresses it. The file is then
    copied to the uncompressed drive in its uncompressed
    state.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="Recompress"></a> <b>Do I need to recompress the drive after add more (uncompressed) files to it?</b>
    <p>No. Whenever you copy a file to a DoubleSpace drive,
    DoubleSpace saves the file in compressed form. It doesn't
    matter whether the file was on the drive when you
    compressed the drive.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="Maintain"></a> <b>If I'm using DoubleSpace, what should I do to maintain my system?</b>
    <p>In general, maintaining a computer that's running
    DoubleSpace is just like maintaining an uncompressed
    system. To ensure the safety of your data and the
    stability of your system, do the following frequently
    (ie. once a week):
    <ul>
      <li>Back up your data files regularly. You can back up
      your files by using either
      <a href="../B/BACKUP.HTM">Backup for MS-DOS</a> or
      <a href="../M/MSBACKUP.HTM">Backup for Windows</a>.<br>
      For more information, see the following section. Also,
      see the chapter "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS
      User's Guide.</li>
      <li>Check your hard disk regularly for logical and
      physical errors. To check and repair a drive, use the
      <a href="../S/SCANDISK.HTM">ScanDisk</a> program.</li>
      <li>Check your computer's memory and hard disk for
      viruses. Viruses can damage data, and can even prevent
      your computer from starting or running properly. To
      check for viruses, use <a href="../M/MSAV.HTM">Anti-Virus</a>.
      Be sure to check all your drives -- compressed and
      uncompressed drives. For more information, see the
      chapter "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS User's Guide.</li>
      <li>Defragment your hard disk drive periodically.
      (Since defragmentation can take a long time, you might
      want to do it at the end of the day.) For more
      information, see the chapter "Managing Your System" in
      the MS-DOS User's Guide.</li>
      <li>Set up <a href="../U/UNDELETE.HTM">Undelete</a> so
      that you can restore any files that you accidentally
      delete. For information about setting up
      <a href="../U/UNDELETE.HTM">Undelete</a>, see the
      chapter "Managing Your System" in the MS-DOS User's
      Guide.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    <a name="HowBackup"></a> <b>How should I back up my files if I'm using DoubleSpace?</b>
    <p>You should back up and restore the files on a
    compressed drive just as you would the files on an
    uncompressed drive. (For information about using
    Microsoft Backup, see the chapter "Managing Your System"
    in the MS-DOS User's Guide.)</p>

    <p>When backing up the files on the host drive (the
    uncompressed drive that contains the compressed volume
    file (CVF) for your compressed drive), you typically do
    not need to back up any files that have names in the
    form DBLSPACE.nnn (ie. DBLSPACE.000). The DBLSPACE.nnn
    file essentially contains your compressed drive.
    Although it is possible to back up the DBLSPACE.nnn file,
    doing so is redundant if you have also backed up the
    files on that compressed drive. In general, it's best to
    back up the files on your compressed drive directly,
    rather than by backing up the associated CVF (the
    DBLSPACE.nnn file). This is because backing up only the
    CVF does not allow you to restore individual files or
    directories later. When you restore the backup copy of a
    DBLSPACE.nnn file, it replaces the entire compressed
    drive with the backup copy. This means that you will
    lose all changes to all files on that drive that were
    made since the backup copy was created.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="OutOfMemory"></a> <b>I installed DoubleSpace and now I'm running out of memory. What can I do?</b>
    <p>If you have an 80386 or higher computer, run
    <a href="../M/MEMMAKER.HTM">MemMaker</a> after
    installing DoubleSpace. <a href="../M/MEMMAKER.HTM">MemMaker</a>
    can move portions of DoubleSpace out of conventional
    memory, which makes more memory available for running
    programs. Also, make sure the
    <a href="../B/BUFFERS.HTM">BUFFERS</a> command in your
    CONFIG.SYS file is set to no more than 10 buffers.</p>

    <p>If you have an 80286 or higher computer with at least
    1 MB of memory, make sure your CONFIG.SYS file contains
    a <a href="DOS.HTM">DOS</a>=HIGH command, a
    <a href="DEVICE.HTM">DEVICE</a> command for
    <a href="../H/HIMEMSYS.HTM">HIMEM.SYS</a> and a
    <a href="DEVICE.HTM">DEVICE</a> command for
    DBLSPACE.SYS. (MS-DOS Setup and DoubleSpace Setup
    normally add these commands to your CONFIG.SYS file.)
    With these commands, the operating system and parts of
    DoubleSpace can load into the high memory area.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="SMARTDrive"></a> <b>Is it all right to run SMARTDrive if I'm using DoubleSpace?</b>
    <p><a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> and
    DoubleSpace are designed to work together. If Setup
    determines that your computer has enough memory to run
    <a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a>, it
    automatically installs
    <a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> by adding a
    SMARTDRV command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  In
    particular, you should run
    <a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> if you are
    running DoubleSpace and you use Windows; in that case,
    using <a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> can
    significantly speed up your computer.</p>

    <p><a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> is
    designed to speed up your system and safeguard your data.
    By default, Setup configures
    <a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> so that
    write-caching is disabled. (If
    <a href="../S/SMARTDRV.HTM">SMARTDrive</a> was originally
    configured to allow write-caching, Setup will not change
    your configuration.) Write-caching provides much faster
    performance than read-only caching, but is not as
    conservative.</p>

    instead, you can convert your system to DriveSpace.
    See <a href="#ConvertToDrive">Converting from DoubleSpace to DriveSpace</a>.</p>

    <p>If you do not currently use DoubleSpace and want to compress

    DoubleSpace drives to DriveSpace format, and also converts your
    system to run DriveSpace instead of DoubleSpace.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The conversion process can take a long time,
    especially if your DoubleSpace drives contain a lot of data.
    You might want to plan to carry out the conversion process overnight.</p>

    <p>For more information about converting to DriveSpace,
    see the README.TXT file.</p>

    <a name="KeepingDoubleSpace"></a> <b>Keeping DoubleSpace files after conversion</b>
    <p>After conversion, do not delete any of your DoubleSpace
    program files, especially the DBLSPACE.BIN file and the
    DBLSPACE.MR1 file.
    These files are required in the following situations:
    <ul>
      <li>DriveSpace requires these files in order to
      convert any DoubleSpace volume files
      (compressed floppy disks) that were not mounted during
      the initial conversion process.</li>
      <li><a href="../S/SCANDISK.HTM">ScanDisk</a> requires
      these files to check and repair any unconverted
      DoubleSpace volume files.</li>
      <li><a href="../../Version/MSDOS/622.HTM">MS-DOS 6.22</a>
      Backup for MS-DOS (<a href="../M/MSBACKUP.HTM">MSBACKUP</a>)
      requires these files to restore compressed backups created
      using the <a href="../../Version/MSDOS/600.HTM">MS-DOS 6</a>
      <a href="../../Version/MSDOS/620.HTM">MS-DOS 6.2</a>
      Backup programs. (Most older backups are compressed backups,
      since those programs created compressed backups by default.)</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    <a name="Floppy"></a> <b>Using DoubleSpace drives and floppy disks with DriveSpace</b>
    <p>DriveSpace converts only DoubleSpace drives that were
    currently mounted during the conversion process. As a
    result, after the conversion is complete, you might still
    have some unconverted DoubleSpace floppy disks or other
    unmounted DoubleSpace volume files. DriveSpace can still
    mount unconverted DoubleSpace drives for read-only access;
    this means that you can read but not change the information
    stored on that drive.</p>

    <p>DriveSpace does not automatically mount DoubleSpace
    floppy disks; to mount an unconverted DoubleSpace floppy
    disk, you must mount it yourself by using the DBLSPACE
    <a href="#SwitchMount">/MOUNT</a> command or by running
    DriveSpace and choosing the Mount command from the Drive
    menu.</p>

    <p>For DriveSpace to mount any DoubleSpace drive for
    full (read/write) access, you must first convert the
    drive to DriveSpace format. Run DriveSpace, and then
    choose Convert DoubleSpace from the Tools menu.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="FixingProblems"></a> <b>Fixing problems with drives compressed using DriveSpace</b>
    <p>To repair disk problems, use the
    <a href="../S/SCANDISK.HTM">ScanDisk</a> program, a
    full-featured disk analysis and repair utility.
    <a href="../S/SCANDISK.HTM">ScanDisk</a> can check and
    repair both compressed and uncompressed drives. It can
    even check and repair unmounted DoubleSpace compressed
    volume files.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="NoSwitches"></a> <b>Running the DBLSPACE command without switches or parameters</b>
    <p>The first time you run the DBLSPACE command, it starts
    the DoubleSpace Setup program. DoubleSpace Setup compresses
    your hard disk drive and loads DBLSPACE.BIN into memory.
    DBLSPACE.BIN is the part of the operating system that
    provides access to compressed drives.</p>

    <p>Thereafter, when you run the DBLSPACE command without
    specifying any switches or parameters, the DoubleSpace
    program starts. This program lists your compressed drives
    and provides menu commands for working with them. You can
    perform all DoubleSpace tasks either from within the
    DoubleSpace program or from the command line.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="BinSys"></a> <b>DBLSPACE.BIN and DBLSPACE.SYS</b>
    <p>DBLSPACE.BIN is the part of what provides access to
    your compressed drives. When you start your computer,
    the operating system loads DBLSPACE.BIN along with other
    operating system functions, before carrying out the
    commands in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
    DBLSPACE.BIN initially loads in conventional memory,
    since it loads before device drivers that provide access
    to upper memory. Normally, if your hard drive has been
    compressed using DoubleSpace, DBLSPACE.BIN is loaded even
    if you press F5 or F8. For information about starting
    your computer without loading DBLSPACE.BIN, see
    <a href="#StartingWithout">Starting your computer without loading DBLSPACE.BIN</a>.</p>

    <p>The DBLSPACE.SYS device driver does not provide access
    to compressed drives; it simply determines the final
    location of DBLSPACE.BIN in memory. When loaded with a
    <a href="DEVICE.HTM">DEVICE</a> command, the
    DBLSPACE.SYS device driver moves DBLSPACE.BIN from the
    top to the bottom of conventional memory. When loaded
    with a
    <a href="DEVICEHI.HTM">DEVICEHIGH</a> command,
    DBLSPACE.SYS moves DBLSPACE.BIN from conventional to
    upper memory, if available. Whenever possible,
    DBLSPACE.SYS moves a portion of DBLSPACE.BIN into the
    HMA.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="StartingWithout"></a> <b>Starting your computer without loading DBLSPACE.BIN</b>
    <p>DBLSPACE.BIN is the part of the operating system that
    provides access to DoubleSpace compressed drives. Normally,
    if your hard drive has been compressed using DoubleSpace,
    DBLSPACE.BIN is loaded even if you press F5 or F8.
    There are two ways to disable this:
    <ol>
      <li>To start your computer without loading DBLSPACE.BIN,
      and to bypass all the commands in your CONFIG.SYS and
      AUTOEXEC.BAT files, press CTRL+F5.</li>
      <li>To start your computer without loading DBLSPACE.BIN,
      and to bypass individual commands in your CONFIG.SYS and
      AUTOEXEC.BAT files, press CTRL+F8. The operating system
      will then prompt you to carry out or bypass each
      CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT command. To carry out all
      remaining startup commands, press ESC. To bypass all
      remaining startup commands, press F5.</li>
    </ol>
    <b>Note:</b> If you bypass DBLSPACE.BIN, you will not be
    able to gain access to your DoubleSpace compressed drives
    until you restart your computer with DBLSPACE.BIN. (Your
    compressed drives will remain on your hard disk as hidden
    files with names such as DBLSPACE.000. Do not delete or
    rename such files.)

    <hr>
    <a name="DriveLetters"></a> <b>How DoubleSpace assigns drive letters</b>
    <p>When you install DoubleSpace, it creates a new drive
    and assigns a drive letter to that drive. DoubleSpace
    <b>skips the first four available drive letters</b> and
    assigns the next available drive letter to the new drive.
    These four drive letters are assigned to additional
    drives.</p>

    <p>When assigning letters to additional drives (when you
    compress another drive), DoubleSpace works backwards from
    the first drive letter it assigned.</p>

    <p>DoubleSpace attempts to avoid drive-letter conflicts
    with drives created by <a href="../F/FDISK.HTM">FDISK</a>,
    <a href="../R/RAMDRIVE.HTM">RAMDrive</a>, networks, or
    other installable device drivers that assign drive
    letters. However, if a drive-letter conflict does occur,
    DoubleSpace resolves the conflict by reassigning its drive
    letters.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="CompressRAMDrive"></a> <b>Compressing a RAMDrive</b>
    <p>To compress a RAMDrive, use the DBLSPACE
    <a href="#SwitchCreate">/CREATE</a> command. Although it
    is possible to compress a RAMDrive by using the DBLSPACE
    <a href="#SwitchCompress">/COMPRESS</a> command, it is
    not recommended. Due to the inherent volatility of a
    RAMDrive, DoubleSpace's automatic recovery mechanisms
    cannot work on a RAMDrive.</p>

    <p>If you compress your RAMDrive, make sure the
    <a href="DEVICE.HTM">DEVICE</a> command for
    RAMDRIVE.SYS appears in your CONFIG.SYS file <b>before</b>
    the <a href="DEVICE.HTM">DEVICE</a>=DBLSPACE.SYS
    command. Otherwise, the compressed RAMDrive will not be
    automatically mounted when your computer starts.</p>

    <hr>
    <a name="DBLSPACEINI"></a> <b>DBLSPACE.INI File</b>
    <p>The DBLSPACE.INI file is a text file with the System,
    Read-Only, and Hidden attributes. DoubleSpace stores this
    file in the root directory of your startup drive. The
    DBLSPACE.INI file contains variables that DoubleSpace
    uses when your computer starts.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Although it is possible to change these
    variables yourself (by using the DBLSPACE command or by
    editing the file directly), you should do so only if you
    understand what they do and what the results might be.
    Before changing the DBLSPACE.INI file, you should make a
    backup copy of the file. For changes to the DBLSPACE.INI
    settings to take effect, you must restart your computer.</p>

    <p>The DBLSPACE.INI file can contain one or more of the
    following variables:
    <ul>
      <li><b>AUTOMOUNT=0|1|A...Z</b> Enables or disables the
      automatic mounting of removable drives, including
      floppy disk drives. By default, DoubleSpace
      automatically mounts all removable drives. To change
      this setting, use the DBLSPACE
      <a href="#SwitchAutomount">/AUTOMOUNT</a> command.</li>
      <li><b>DOUBLEGUARD=0|1</b> The DOUBLEGUARD setting
      enables or disables DoubleGuard(tm) safety checking.
      When DoubleGuard is enabled, DoubleSpace will
      constantly check its memory for damage by some other
      program. By default, DoubleGuard is enabled. To change
      this setting, use the DBLSPACE
      <a href="#SwitchDoubleguard">/DOUBLEGUARD</a> command.</li>
      <li><b>LASTDRIVE=drive</b> The LASTDRIVE setting
      specifies the highest drive letter available for use
      by DoubleSpace. To change this setting, use the DBLSPACE
      <a href="#SwitchLastdrive">/LASTDRIVE</a> command.</li>
      <li><b>MAXFILEFRAGMENTS=n</b> The MAXFILEFRAGMENTS
      setting sets the limit for the amount of fragmentation
      allowed for all mounted compressed volume files. To
      change this setting, use the DBLSPACE
      <a href="#SwitchMaxfilefragments">/MAXFILEFRAGMENTS</a>
      command.</li>
      <li><b>/MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES=n</b> The
      MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES setting specifies how many
      additional drives DoubleSpace should allocate memory
      for when your computer starts. This determines how
      many additional compressed drives you can create,
      compress, or mount without restarting your computer.
      To change this setting, use the DBLSPACE
      <a href="#SwitchMaxremovabledrives">/MAXREMOVABLEDRIVES</a>
      command.</li>
      <li><b>ROMSERVER=0|1</b> Enables or disables the check
      for a ROM BIOS Microsoft Real-time Compresson
      Interface (MRCI) server. By default, the ROM MRCI
      check is disabled. To change this setting, use the
      DBLSPACE <a href="#SwitchRomserver">/ROMSERVER</a> command.</li>
      <li><b>SWITCHES=/F|/N|/FN</b> Controls the way the
      CTRL+F5 and CTRL+F8 keys work. (Normally, you can
      press CTRL+F5 or CTRL+F8 to bypass DoubleSpace when
      your computer starts.) To change this setting, use the
      DBLSPACE <a href="#SwitchSwitches">/SWITCHES</a> command.
      (To remove SWITCHES settings from your DBLSPACE.INI
      file, you must edit the file directly.)</li>
      <li><b>ActivateDrive=x,yn</b> This setting specifies
      that DoubleSpace should mount a compressed volume file
      when your computer starts. The DBLSPACE.INI file can
      contain more than one ActivateDrive setting. Except
      for the host drive letter, which you can change by
      using the DBLSPACE <a href="#SwitchHost">/HOST</a>
      command, do not change the ActivateDrive setting yourself.
      The ActivateDrive setting requires the following parameters:
      <ul>
        <li><b>x</b> The drive letter to assign to the newly
        mounted compressed drive.</li>
        <li><b>y</b> The drive letter of the host drive. To
        change the host drive letter, use the DBLSPACE
        <a href="#SwitchHost">/HOST</a> command.</li>
        <li><b>n</b> The number of the compressed volume
        file (CVF). To determine the CVF number, examine its
        filename extension. If the CVF filename is
        DBLSPACE.000, set n to 0; if the CVF filename is
        DBLSPACE.001, set n to 1, and so on.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>FIRSTDRIVE=x</b> Set by DoubleSpace each time it
      modifies the DBLSPACE.INI file. DoubleSpace uses this
      setting to control the overall assignment of drive
      letters. Do not change this setting yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="Examples"></a> <b>Examples</b>
    <p>If you have floppy drives A and B, and a Bernoulli

<pre>
    DBLSPACE <a href="#SwitchAutomount">/AUTOMOUNT=1</a>
</pre>

    <p><b>Note:</b> Before a floppy drive actually mounts,
    you must insert the floppy disk in the drive, and then

</pre>

    <p>Because this command does not specify how much space
    to leave uncompressed, DoubleSpace leaves 2 MB of
    uncompressed space (the default). Because the command
    does not specify a drive letter for the uncompressed
