<!-- INBODYEND -->The Oort cloud is an immense spherical cloud surrounding the planetary 
system and extending approximately 3 light years, about 30 trillion kilometers from 
the <a href="sun.htm">Sun</a>. This vast distance is considered the edge of the 
Sun&#39;s orb of physical, gravitational, or dynamical influence.
<p>Within the cloud, <a href="Comets.htm">comets</a> are typically tens of millions 
of kilometers apart. They are weakly bound to the sun, and passing stars and other 
forces can readily change their orbits, sending them into the inner solar system 
or out to interstellar space. This is especially true of comets on the outer edges 
of the Oort cloud. The structure of the cloud is believed to consist of a relatively 
dense core that lies near the ecliptic plane and gradually replenishes the outer 
boundaries, creating a steady state. One sixth of an estimated six trillion icy 
objects or comets are in the outer region with the remainder in the relatively dense 
core. </p>
<p>In addition to stellar perturbations where another star&#39;s Oort cloud passes through 
or close to the Sun&#39;s Oort cloud, are the influences of giant molecular clouds and 
tidal forces. A giant molecular-cloud is by far more massive than the Sun. It is 
an accumulation of cold hydrogen that is the birthplace of stars and solar systems. These are infrequently encountered, about 
every 300-500 million years, but when they are encountered, they can violently redistribute 
comets within the Oort cloud. </p>
<p>Tidal forces affecting the Oort cloud come from stars in the Milky Way&#39;s galactic 
disk with some pull from the galactic core. The tide results from the sun and comets 
being different distances from these massive amounts of matter. The force on the 
comets from these tides is greater than the perturbations of passing stars, and 
comets beyond 200,000 AU are easily lost to interstellar space. This pull contributes 
to the steady state which replenishes the outer comets that are randomly distributed 
away from the ecliptic plane. </p>
<p>The total mass of comets in the Oort cloud is estimated to be 40 times that of 
Earth. This matter is believed to have originated at different distances and therefore 
temperatures from the sun, which explains the compositional diversity observed in 
comets. </p>
<p>Typical noontime temperatures are four degrees Celsius above absolute zero. As 
temperatures move toward absolute zero, the kinetic energy of the molecules approach 
a finite value. Absolute zero should not be considered a state of zero energy without 
motion. There still remains some molecular energy, although it is at a minimum, 
at absolute zero. </p>
<p>The Oort cloud is the source of long-period comets and possibly higher-inclination 
intermediate comets that were pulled into shorter period orbits by the planets, 
such as Halley and Swift-Tuttle. Comets can also shift 
their orbits due to jets of gas and dust that rocket from their icy surface as they 
approach the sun. Although they get off course, comets do have initial orbits with 
widely different ranges, from 200 years to once every million years or more. Comets 
entering the planetary region for the first time, come from an average distance 
of 44,000 astronomical units. </p>
<p>Long period comets can appear at any time and come from any direction. Bright 
comets can usually be seen every 5-10 years. Two recent Oort cloud comets were Hyakutake 
and Hale-Bopp. Hyakutake was average in size, but came to 0.10 AU (15,000,000 km) 
from <a href="earth.htm">Earth</a>, which made it appear especially spectacular. 
Hale-Bopp, on the other hand, was an unusually large and dynamic comet, ten times 
that of Halley at comparable distances from the sun, making it appear quite bright, 
even though it did not approach closer than 1.32 AU (197,000,000 km) to the Earth.
</p>
<p>Recognition of the Oort cloud gave explanation to the age old questions: &quot;What 
are comets, and where do they come from?&quot; In 1950, Jan H. Oort inferred the existence 
of the Oort cloud from the physical evidence of long-period comets entering the 
planetary system. This Dutch astronomer, who determined the rotation of the Milky 
Way galaxy in the 1920&#39;s, interpreted comet orbital distribution with only 19 well-measured 
orbits to study and successfully recognized where these comets came from. Additional 
gathered data has since confirmed his studies, establishing and expanding our knowledge 
of the Oort cloud. </p>
