<p><b>What is Alzheimer's Disease?<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease 
characterized in the brain by abnormal clumps (amyloid plaques) and tangled 
bundles of fibers (neurofibrillary tangles) composed of misplaced proteins. Age 
is the most important risk factor for AD; the number of people with the disease 
doubles every 5 years beyond age 65. Three genes have been discovered that cause 
early onset (familial) AD. Other genetic mutations that cause excessive 
accumulation of amyloid protein are associated with age-related (sporadic) AD. 
Symptoms of AD include memory loss, language deterioration, impaired ability to 
mentally manipulate visual information, poor judgment, confusion, restlessness, 
and mood swings. Eventually AD destroys cognition, personality, and the ability 
to function. The early symptoms of AD, which include forgetfulness and loss of 
concentration, are often missed because they resemble natural signs of aging.

  There is no cure for AD and no way to slow the progression of the disease. For 
  some people in the early or middle stages of AD, medication such as tacrine (Cognex) 
  may alleviate some cognitive symptoms. Donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine 
  (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may keep some symptoms from becoming worse 
  for a limited time. A fifth drug, memantine (Namenda), was recently approved 
  for use in the United States. Combining memantine with other AD drugs may be 
  more effective than any single therapy. One controlled clinical trial found 
  that patients receiving donepezil plus memantine had better cognition and 
  other functions than patients receiving donepezil alone. Also, other 
  medications may help control behavioral symptoms such as sleeplessness, 
  agitation, wandering, anxiety, and depression.

  AD is a progressive disease, but its course can vary from 5 to 20 years. The 
  most common cause of death in AD patients is infection.</div>
