			<p><b>Non-natural-born citizens are ineligible</b><br>
			Persons who are not natural-born citizens, such as former Secretary 
			of Labor Elaine Chao (born in Taiwan), are constitutionally ineligible 
			to the office of President, as are persons who are not at least thirty-five 
			years old or have not resided in the United States for fourteen years. 
			This is specified in the Presidential Succession Act.</p>
			<p><b>Acting officers are ineligible</b><br>
			To be in the line of succession, an officer must have been appointed 
			and confirmed by the United States Senate, prior to the death, resignation, 
			removal from office, inability, or otherwise failure to qualify of the 
			President pro tempore. Therefore, acting officers who have not been 
			confirmed into the position cannot be in the line of succession.</p>
			<p><b>Constitutional foundation</b><br>
			The line of succession is mentioned in three places in the Constitution: 
			in Article II, Section 1, in Section 3 of the 20th Amendment, and in 
			the 25th Amendment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 makes the Vice President first 
				in the line of succession and allows the Congress to provide by 
				law for cases in which neither the President nor Vice President 
				can serve. The current such law governing succession is the Presidential 
				Succession Act of 1947.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Section 3 of the 20th Amendment provides that if the President-elect 
				dies before his term begins, the Vice President-elect becomes President 
				on Inauguration Day and serves for the full term to which the President-elect 
				was elected. The section also provides that if, on Inauguration 
				Day, a president has not been chosen or the President-elect does 
				not qualify for the presidency, the Vice President-elect acts as 
				president until a president is chosen or the President-elect qualifies. 
				Finally, Section 3 allows the Congress to provide by law for cases 
				in which neither a President-elect nor a Vice President-elect is 
				eligible or available to serve.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
				<li>The 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967, clarified Article II, 
				Section 1: that the Vice President is the direct successor of the 
				President. He or she becomes President if the President dies, resigns 
				or is removed from office. The 25th also provides for the situation 
				where the President is temporarily disabled, such as if the President 
				has a surgical procedure or becomes mentally unstable. It also required 
				vice presidential vacancies to be filled by the President and confirmed 
				by Congress. Previously, when a vice president had succeeded to 
				the presidency or otherwise left the office empty (through death, 
				resignation, or removal from office), the vice presidency remained 
				vacant.</li>
