<p>Is it simply a temple? How could it take its place among other unique structures 
such as the Pyramid, the Hanging Gardens, and the Colossus of Rhodes? For the people 
who actually visited it, the answer was simple. It was not just a temple... It was 
the most beautiful structure on earth... It was built in honor of the Greek goddess 
of hunting, wild nature, and fertility. That was the Temple of
<a href="http://messagenet.com/myths/bios/artemis.html">Artemis</a> at Ephesus.
</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The ancient city of <a href="http://www.ephesusguide.com/">Ephesus</a> near the 
modern town of Selcuk, about 50 km south of
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/turkey/izmir/">Izmir</a> (Smyrna) in
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/turkey/">Turkey</a>. </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although the foundation of the temple dates back to the seventh century BC, the 
structure that earned a spot in the list of Wonders was built around 550 BC. Referred 
to as the great marble temple, or temple D, it was sponsored by the Lydian king 
Croesus and was designed by the Greek architect Chersiphron. <span lang="en-us">
The Temple</span> was decorated with bronze statues sculpted by the most skilled 
artists of their time: Pheidias, Polycleitus, Kresilas, and Phradmon. </p>
<p>The temple served as both a marketplace and a religious institution. For years, 
the sanctuary was visited by merchants, tourists, artisans, and kings who paid homage 
to the goddess by sharing their profits with her. Recent archeological excavations 
at the site revealed gifts from pilgrims including statuettes of Artemis made of 
gold and ivory... earrings, bracelets, and necklaces... artifacts from as far as
<a href="http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~sebrahi/PersiaNet.html">Persia</a> and
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/india/">India</a>. </p>
<p>On the night of 21 July 356 BC, a man named Herostratus burned the temple to 
ground in a<span lang="en-us">n</span> attempt to immortalize his name<span lang="en-us">, 
which h</span>e did indeed. <span lang="en-us">Oddly</span> enough,
<a href="http://www.wallop.demon.co.uk/alexander/index.htm">Alexander the Great</a> 
was born the same night. The historian
<a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Classics/titlelist.html#Plutarch">Plutarch</a> 
later wrote that the goddess was &quot;too busy taking care of the birth of Alexander 
to send help to her threatened temple&quot;. And when Alexander the Great conquered
<a href="http://www.city.net/countries/turkey/">Asia Minor</a>, he
<span lang="en-us">offered to </span>rebuild the destroyed temple<span lang="en-us">, 
but the Temple was not restored until after his death in 323 BC.&nbsp; T</span>he 
temple was <span lang="en-us">eventually </span>restored and is labeled &quot;<span lang="en-us">T</span>emple 
E&quot; by archeologists.</p>
<p>When St Paul visited Ephesus to preach Christianity in the first century AD, 
he was confronted by the Artemis&#39; cult who had no plans to abandon their goddess. 
And when the temple was again destroyed by the Goths in AD 262, the Ephesians vowed 
to rebuild. By the fourth century AD, most Ephesians had converted to Christianity 
and the temple lost its religious glamor. The final chapter came when in AD 401 
the Temple of Artemis was torn down by St John Chrysostom. Ephesus was later deserted, 
and only in the late nineteenth century has the site been excavated. The digging 
revealed the temple&#39;s foundation and the road to the now swampy site. Attempts were 
recently made to rebuilt the temple, but only a few columns have been re-erected.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The foundation of the temple was rectangular in form, similar to most temples 
at the time. Unlike other sanctuaries, however, the building was made of marble, 
with a decorated façade overlooking a spacious courtyard. Marble steps surrounding 
the building platform led to the high terrace which was approximately 80 m (260 
ft) by 130 m (430 ft) in plan. The columns were 20 m (60 ft) high with Ionic capitals 
and carved circular sides. There were 127 columns in total, aligned orthogonally 
over the whole platform area, except for the central cella or house of the goddess.
</p>
<p>The temple housed many works of art, including four ancient bronze statues of 
Amazons sculpted by the finest artists at the time. When St Paul visited the city, 
the temple was adorned with golden pillars and silver statuettes, and was decorated 
with paintings. There is no evidence that a statue of the goddess herself was placed 
at the center of the sanctuary, but there is no reason not to believe so. </p>
<p>The early detailed descriptions of the temple helped archeologists reconstruct 
the building. Many reconstructions such as that by
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/artemis_bw.jpg">H.F. von Erlach</a> 
depicted the façade with a four-column porch which never existed.
<a href="http://ce.eng.usf.edu/pharos/wonders/Gallery/artemis_color.jpg">More accurate 
reconstructions</a> may give us an idea about the general layout of the temple. 
However, its true beauty lies in the architectural and artistic details which will 
forever remain unknown.</p>
