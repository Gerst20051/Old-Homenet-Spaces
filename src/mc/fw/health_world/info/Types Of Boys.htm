    <font color="deeppink" size="4"><strong><u>The Computer Geek</u></strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="darkorchid"><strong>How To Recognize Him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">You probably know the type I&#39;m talking about. He&#39;s very 
    clever, probably in all the top sets. His main things are his computer, his 
    Gameboy, his Playstation...you understand. That is his life. I do not wish to 
    stereotype, but he will probably either have really nasty hair or he will put 
    so much gel on it that it will resemble a pan of chip fat. He can be quite good-looking 
    but doesn&#39;t really take much time on his appearance. He hangs around with other 
    computer geeks and the chances are you won&#39;t be able to stand them. He can be 
    outwardly funny and goofy but inside lurks a shy, sensitive little creature.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>Where You&#39;ll Find Him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">Primarily, anywhere there is a computer. He may be in 
    the library. Or, he will be hanging out with his friends in the usual computer 
    geeks&#39; hideout...your job is to find wherever your school&#39;s one is.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>He Likes: </strong><font color="magenta">His 
    computer and Playstation/Gameboy, obviously. He likes having a laugh, but you 
    may find his sense of humor weird...whatever turns you on! He also likes girls, 
    though it may not seem that obvious.</font></font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>He Dislikes: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">Losing a computer game, Other boys who are not on &#39;his 
    level&#39;, and &#39;normality&#39;.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>How To Get Him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">If your usual flirting style is very outrageous, please 
    don&#39;t try it on him. Chances are he&#39;s very shy, or failing that, just not interested. 
    However, you will need to be obvious, because he may be clever but he&#39;s very 
    dim when it comes to stuff like that. So Obvious, but NOT outrageous. If you 
    know anything about computers or games or whatever, that&#39;ll impress him as a 
    conversation starting point, but if not, please don&#39;t embarrass yourself.
    </font></p>
    <p><font color="deeppink" size="4"><strong><u>The Busy Hands Boy</u></strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="darkorchid"><strong>How to recognize him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">He&#39;s always chasing, following, or touching/hugging/putting 
    his arm around some girl, and it&#39;s always a different one. The kind of boy you&#39;d 
    usually take a ten mile hike to avoid (well, that&#39;s me, not sure about you). 
    Unfortunately, he&#39;s usually drop dead gorgeous and therefore very difficult 
    to resist. He&#39;ll have gelled, spiky hair and a cheeky, flirty smile. He&#39;ll also 
    have a looooooooooooong history of ex-girlfriends.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>Where You&#39;ll find him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">Either with his mates talking (in a very degrading manner, 
    obviously) ABOUT girls, or with a girl trying to butter her up. He&#39;s probably 
    very popular, with a large group of friends, so chances are you&#39;ll know his 
    territory anyway.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>He Likes: </strong><font color="magenta">Jordan, 
    Britney, J.Lo, Beyonce.....Girls in general</font><strong><img src="../../../../i/mc/fw/health_world/info/All%20About%20Life%20And%20Boys/rolleyes.gif" width="20" height="20"></strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>He Dislikes: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">Girls kicking him where the sun don&#39;t shine. (When you&#39;re 
    this kind of boy, it does happen on a regular basis)</font></p>
    <p><font color="#9932cc"><strong>How To Get Him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">Basically, to get this boy, you have to play hard to get. 
    He loves the challenge of the chase and if you give in to him straight away, 
    the chances are he&#39;ll get bored with you. If he hasn&#39;t noticed you, flirt very 
    outrageously with him so that he DOES notice you. Once you&#39;ve got him eating 
    out the palm of your hand, suddenly cool off. It&#39;ll leave him determined to 
    get you, and once he does, he&#39;ll be much keener to hang on to you for as long 
    as possible. It will also keep his hands away from any OTHER girl who dares 
    to cross his path.</font></p>
    <p><strong><font color="deeppink" size="4"><u>The Untouchable Boy</u></font></strong></p>
    <p><font color="blueviolet"><strong>How To Recognize him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">This one&#39;s not hard to recognize. He doesn&#39;t need to be 
    fantastically good-looking (though this is often the case) but there&#39;s always 
    SOME little thing about him that gets the girls flocking to him like sheep. Something 
    you can&#39;t quite put your finger on. Loads of girls fancy the pants off him, 
    but he is simply very, very, very picky. He doesn&#39;t want any of them. He&#39;ll 
    have a haughty air, and probably a dry or cynical sense of humor. He&#39;s popular 
    amongst his friends as the joker of the group. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2"><strong>Where You&#39;ll Find Him: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">In the middle of his group of friends, making them all 
    laugh, or blowing off some poor girl.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2"><strong>He likes: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">Well, not many of the girls that like HIM, that&#39;s for 
    sure. He likes his friends, and his Playstation.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2"><strong>He Dislikes: </strong></font>
    <font color="magenta">See above sentence about girls. He also hates being got 
    the better of.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#8a2be2"><strong>How To Get Him:</strong></font><font color="magenta"> 
    Similar strategy to busy-hands boy, but more subtle. First off, you HAVE to 
    start an argument with him. A fun-one, obviously, not a serious one, or he&#39;ll 
    never look at you again. That way, you&#39;ll always have a conversation-base and 
    something to tease him with. And when this boy starts teasing you, you know 
    you&#39;re on to a good thing. When he teases, you flirt and tease him back. Smile 
    at him a lot...he likes that.</font></font></p>
